       "0  and now we are on year two—the bag is still fully functional. for the past two years this bag has been indoors a total of four nights, nights where the threat of heavy freezing rain would hinder the morning commute. the rest of the time it is in the new england elements. i’ll add a photo. it is faded to a very light gray, but zipper still fine and it carries my stuff just fine.after one year, i’m writing a new review. i have an interesting bicycle life: i commute by bicycle. i ride twelve miles to work five days a week, regardless of temperature or conditions. so give or take a few dozen miles, i bike about 3,000 miles per year.i also abuse my bike. i leave it outside in snow, sleet, rain, hail, and the summer sun. it is a 1995 trek iron horse. it is a beast. so any equipment i purchase is in for a test.i’m uploading a photo of this bag one year later. it is a little faded, but it is as functional as the day i strapped it on. i truly thought i would get a few months out of it at maximum. judging from its condition after 3,000 miles, i think i’ll get many more years out of it.it is spacious enough to hold my iphone, a boo kit, a repair kit, my keys, and a sandwich. it is a remarkable piece of equipment. i have bought two more, one for my other bike and one as a gift.   \n",

       "0  and now we are on year two—the bag is still fully functional. for the past two years this bag has been indoors a total of four nights, nights where the threat of heavy freezing rain would hinder the morning commute. the rest of the time it is in the new england elements. i’ll add a photo. it is faded to a very light gray, but zipper still fine and it carries my stuff just fine.after one year, i’m writing a new review. i have an interesting bicycle life: i commute by bicycle. i ride twelve miles to work five days a week, regardless of temperature or conditions. so give or take a few dozen miles, i bike about 3,000 miles per year.i also abuse my bike. i leave it outside in snow, sleet, rain, hail, and the summer sun. it is a 1995 trek iron horse. it is a beast. so any equipment i purchase is in for a test.i’m uploading a photo of this bag one year later. it is a little faded, but it is as functional as the day i strapped it on. i truly thought i would get a few months out of it at maximum. judging from its condition after 3,000 miles, i think i’ll get many more years out of it.it is spacious enough to hold my iphone, a boo kit, a repair kit, my keys, and a sandwich. it is a remarkable piece of equipment. i have bought two more, one for my other bike and one as a gift.   \n",
       "1  this is one of those products that actually looks better when you get it! i was a little hesitant in purchasing this as i thought it would not allow room for my water bottle and hand air pump-- no problem, take a look at attached images. the bonus is it holds my leatherman wave knife w/ belt case, note 8 w/ extra large case, tire patch kit, wallet and pro bike tool mini ratchet tool set with a tiny bit of room left over. it also stays secure and out of the way while pedaling.it is an amazing bike storage bag and extremely user friendly taking a full 2 minutes to install! as you can see by the picture i purchased another one. we ride in the northwest mountains of maine and enjoy carrying all the essentials without a back pack or saddle bags.highly recommend this product!recommendation: recommend applying lip balm (bees wax) to the zipper to keep zipper opening easily and to prevent undue stress on the stitching.happy trails! :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "0  and now we are on year two—the bag is still fully functional. for the past two years this bag has been indoors a total of four nights, nights where the threat of heavy freezing rain would hinder the morning commute. the rest of the time it is in the new england elements. i’ll add a photo. it is faded to a very light gray, but zipper still fine and it carries my stuff just fine.after one year, i’m writing a new review. i have an interesting bicycle life: i commute by bicycle. i ride twelve miles to work five days a week, regardless of temperature or conditions. so give or take a few dozen miles, i bike about 3,000 miles per year.i also abuse my bike. i leave it outside in snow, sleet, rain, hail, and the summer sun. it is a 1995 trek iron horse. it is a beast. so any equipment i purchase is in for a test.i’m uploading a photo of this bag one year later. it is a little faded, but it is as functional as the day i strapped it on. i truly thought i would get a few months out of it at maximum. judging from its condition after 3,000 miles, i think i’ll get many more years out of it.it is spacious enough to hold my iphone, a boo kit, a repair kit, my keys, and a sandwich. it is a remarkable piece of equipment. i have bought two more, one for my other bike and one as a gift.   \n",

       "0  and now we are on year two—the bag is still fully functional. for the past two years this bag has been indoors a total of four nights, nights where the threat of heavy freezing rain would hinder the morning commute. the rest of the time it is in the new england elements. i’ll add a photo. it is faded to a very light gray, but zipper still fine and it carries my stuff just fine.after one year, i’m writing a new review. i have an interesting bicycle life: i commute by bicycle. i ride twelve miles to work five days a week, regardless of temperature or conditions. so give or take a few dozen miles, i bike about 3,000 miles per year.i also abuse my bike. i leave it outside in snow, sleet, rain, hail, and the summer sun. it is a 1995 trek iron horse. it is a beast. so any equipment i purchase is in for a test.i’m uploading a photo of this bag one year later. it is a little faded, but it is as functional as the day i strapped it on. i truly thought i would get a few months out of it at maximum. judging from its condition after 3,000 miles, i think i’ll get many more years out of it.it is spacious enough to hold my iphone, a boo kit, a repair kit, my keys, and a sandwich. it is a remarkable piece of equipment. i have bought two more, one for my other bike and one as a gift.   \n",
       "1  this is one of those products that actually looks better when you get it! i was a little hesitant in purchasing this as i thought it would not allow room for my water bottle and hand air pump-- no problem, take a look at attached images. the bonus is it holds my leatherman wave knife w/ belt case, note 8 w/ extra large case, tire patch kit, wallet and pro bike tool mini ratchet tool set with a tiny bit of room left over. it also stays secure and out of the way while pedaling.it is an amazing bike storage bag and extremely user friendly taking a full 2 minutes to install! as you can see by the picture i purchased another one. we ride in the northwest mountains of maine and enjoy carrying all the essentials without a back pack or saddle bags.highly recommend this product!recommendation: recommend applying lip balm (bees wax) to the zipper to keep zipper opening easily and to prevent undue stress on the stitching.happy trails! :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
