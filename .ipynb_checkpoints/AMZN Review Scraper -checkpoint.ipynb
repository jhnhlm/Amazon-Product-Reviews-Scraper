       "2  i love this frame bike bag! well made, big enough but not bulky, straps on securely! i use it to carry a tire repair kit with pump, my key fob and wallet. doesn't get in the way while riding! looks great!!! very functional and keeps it's shape! if you're looking for a nice carry bag for your bike, this is it!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "3  this is a very nice bag for the money. very functional. i use mine to store my tools, mini pump, spare tube etc. be aware that if your top tube slants down, it will be a tight fit with your water bottle (see picture). my bike is a trek fx2 hybrid with an angled top tube so this bag pushes up against the water bottle and looks a little weird. but it fits and works fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "4  i put topeak bike rack on my other bikes and also have a topeak saddle bag. i didn't want to put a rack on this mountain bike as i want to keep it light. i didn't want to use a saddle bag because i need to adjust the seat height during my rides and the saddle bag would be a problem. i also have a backpack and a waist pack but the backpack isn't that comfortable and the waist pack is simply too small for storage. when i saw the aduro storage bag, i thought it was perfect. it is actually a pretty large storage bag and can hold a lot of stuff. i need to carry a spare tube, co2 tire inflator or topeak peakini mini pump, phone, keys, nutrition bar, etc.. with this bag, i can comfortably carry all my essential items (not including my bike lock)..... con? none so far. it makes contact with my thermos water bottle but not an issue.   \n",
