       "0  and now we are on year two—the bag is still fully functional. for the past two years this bag has been indoors a total of four nights, nights where the threat of heavy freezing rain would hinder the morning commute. the rest of the time it is in the new england elements. i’ll add a photo. it is faded to a very light gray, but zipper still fine and it carries my stuff just fine.  after one year, i’m writing a new review. i have an interesting bicycle life: i commute by bicycle. i ride twelve miles to work five days a week, regardless of temperature or conditions. so give or take a few dozen miles, i bike about 3,000 miles per year.  i also abuse my bike. i leave it outside in snow, sleet, rain, hail, and the summer sun. it is a 1995 trek iron horse. it is a beast. so any equipment i purchase is in for a test.  i’m uploading a photo of this bag one year later. it is a little faded, but it is as functional as the day i strapped it on. i truly thought i would get a few months out of it at maximum. judging from its condition after 3,000 miles, i think i’ll get many more years out of it.  it is spacious enough to hold my iphone, a boo kit, a repair kit, my keys, and a sandwich. it is a remarkable piece of equipment. i have bought two more, one for my other bike and one as a gift.   \n",
       "1  this is one of those products that actually looks better when you get it! i was a little hesitant in purchasing this as i thought it would not allow room for my water bottle and hand air pump-- no problem, take a look at attached images. the bonus is it holds my leatherman wave knife w/ belt case, note 8 w/ extra large case, tire patch kit, wallet and pro bike tool mini ratchet tool set with a tiny bit of room left over. it also stays secure and out of the way while pedaling.  it is an amazing bike storage bag and extremely user friendly taking a full 2 minutes to install! as you can see by the picture i purchased another one. we ride in the northwest mountains of maine and enjoy carrying all the essentials without a back pack or saddle bags.  highly recommend this product!  recommendation: recommend applying lip balm (bees wax) to the zipper to keep zipper opening easily and to prevent undue stress on the stitching.  happy trails! :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "3  this is a very nice bag for the money. very functional. i use mine to store my tools, mini pump, spare tube etc. be aware that if your top tube slants down, it will be a tight fit with your water bottle (see picture). my bike is a trek fx2 hybrid with an angled top tube so this bag pushes up against the water bottle and looks a little weird. but it fits and works fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "4  i put topeak bike rack on my other bikes and also have a topeak saddle bag. i didn't want to put a rack on this mountain bike as i want to keep it light. i didn't want to use a saddle bag because i need to adjust the seat height during my rides and the saddle bag would be a problem. i also have a backpack and a waist pack but the backpack isn't that comfortable and the waist pack is simply too small for storage. when i saw the aduro storage bag, i thought it was perfect. it is actually a pretty large storage bag and can hold a lot of stuff. i need to carry a spare tube, co2 tire inflator or topeak peakini mini pump, phone, keys, nutrition bar, etc.. with this bag, i can comfortably carry all my essential items (not including my bike lock)..... con? none so far. it makes contact with my thermos water bottle but not an issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "0  and now we are on year two—the bag is still fully functional. for the past two years this bag has been indoors a total of four nights, nights where the threat of heavy freezing rain would hinder the morning commute. the rest of the time it is in the new england elements. i’ll add a photo. it is faded to a very light gray, but zipper still fine and it carries my stuff just fine.  after one year, i’m writing a new review. i have an interesting bicycle life: i commute by bicycle. i ride twelve miles to work five days a week, regardless of temperature or conditions. so give or take a few dozen miles, i bike about 3,000 miles per year.  i also abuse my bike. i leave it outside in snow, sleet, rain, hail, and the summer sun. it is a 1995 trek iron horse. it is a beast. so any equipment i purchase is in for a test.  i’m uploading a photo of this bag one year later. it is a little faded, but it is as functional as the day i strapped it on. i truly thought i would get a few months out of it at maximum. judging from its condition after 3,000 miles, i think i’ll get many more years out of it.  it is spacious enough to hold my iphone, a boo kit, a repair kit, my keys, and a sandwich. it is a remarkable piece of equipment. i have bought two more, one for my other bike and one as a gift.   \n",
       "1  this is one of those products that actually looks better when you get it! i was a little hesitant in purchasing this as i thought it would not allow room for my water bottle and hand air pump-- no problem, take a look at attached images. the bonus is it holds my leatherman wave knife w/ belt case, note 8 w/ extra large case, tire patch kit, wallet and pro bike tool mini ratchet tool set with a tiny bit of room left over. it also stays secure and out of the way while pedaling.  it is an amazing bike storage bag and extremely user friendly taking a full 2 minutes to install! as you can see by the picture i purchased another one. we ride in the northwest mountains of maine and enjoy carrying all the essentials without a back pack or saddle bags.  highly recommend this product!  recommendation: recommend applying lip balm (bees wax) to the zipper to keep zipper opening easily and to prevent undue stress on the stitching.  happy trails! :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
