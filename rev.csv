5.0 out of 5 stars,"and now we are on year two—the bag is still fully functional. for the past two years this bag has been indoors a total of four nights, nights where the threat of heavy freezing rain would hinder the morning commute. the rest of the time it is in the new england elements. i’ll add a photo. it is faded to a very light gray, but zipper still fine and it carries my stuff just fine.after one year, i’m writing a new review. i have an interesting bicycle life: i commute by bicycle. i ride twelve miles to work five days a week, regardless of temperature or conditions. so give or take a few dozen miles, i bike about 3,000 miles per year.i also abuse my bike. i leave it outside in snow, sleet, rain, hail, and the summer sun. it is a 1995 trek iron horse. it is a beast. so any equipment i purchase is in for a test.i’m uploading a photo of this bag one year later. it is a little faded, but it is as functional as the day i strapped it on. i truly thought i would get a few months out of it at maximum. judging from its condition after 3,000 miles, i think i’ll get many more years out of it.it is spacious enough to hold my iphone, a boo kit, a repair kit, my keys, and a sandwich. it is a remarkable piece of equipment. i have bought two more, one for my other bike and one as a gift."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is one of those products that actually looks better when you get it! i was a little hesitant in purchasing this as i thought it would not allow room for my water bottle and hand air pump-- no problem, take a look at attached images. the bonus is it holds my leatherman wave knife w/ belt case, note 8 w/ extra large case, tire patch kit, wallet and pro bike tool mini ratchet tool set with a tiny bit of room left over. it also stays secure and out of the way while pedaling.it is an amazing bike storage bag and extremely user friendly taking a full 2 minutes to install! as you can see by the picture i purchased another one. we ride in the northwest mountains of maine and enjoy carrying all the essentials without a back pack or saddle bags.highly recommend this product!recommendation: recommend applying lip balm (bees wax) to the zipper to keep zipper opening easily and to prevent undue stress on the stitching.happy trails! :)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this frame bike bag! well made, big enough but not bulky, straps on securely! i use it to carry a tire repair kit with pump, my key fob and wallet. doesn't get in the way while riding! looks great!!! very functional and keeps it's shape! if you're looking for a nice carry bag for your bike, this is it!!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a very nice bag for the money. very functional. i use mine to store my tools, mini pump, spare tube etc. be aware that if your top tube slants down, it will be a tight fit with your water bottle (see picture). my bike is a trek fx2 hybrid with an angled top tube so this bag pushes up against the water bottle and looks a little weird. but it fits and works fine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i put topeak bike rack on my other bikes and also have a topeak saddle bag. i didn't want to put a rack on this mountain bike as i want to keep it light. i didn't want to use a saddle bag because i need to adjust the seat height during my rides and the saddle bag would be a problem. i also have a backpack and a waist pack but the backpack isn't that comfortable and the waist pack is simply too small for storage. when i saw the aduro storage bag, i thought it was perfect. it is actually a pretty large storage bag and can hold a lot of stuff. i need to carry a spare tube, co2 tire inflator or topeak peakini mini pump, phone, keys, nutrition bar, etc.. with this bag, i can comfortably carry all my essential items (not including my bike lock)..... con? none so far. it makes contact with my thermos water bottle but not an issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"works extremely well. it would be perfect except it doesn't hang absolutely centered under the cross bar due to positioning of velcro straps. however, that's not a performance issue. it's large and easily holds an iphone6+, xtra tubes and repair stuff. i'm 6'2"" and have a large bike frame, and the size still interferes with a water bottle on the seat tube, so i just bought a larger bottle for the down tube bottle cage."
1.0 out of 5 stars,the straps are so long the fuzzy part ends up overlapping itself and the velcro cannot secure itself down. the stitch job connecting the velcro is pathetic. made with zero quality assurance. it was also punctured 6 different times to secure the cardboard packaging with the branding on it. who does that? just outright damages the product just to hold cardboard in place. it was already bagged. redundant. these products are shamelessly mass produced with not a care in the world if all of it ends up in a landfill. how hard is it to actually look at the product and test it along the way!?
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this seemed like a winner. i found a nice way to hang it off the top bar, velcro held well, bag zipped well. i loaded it with a small battery op pump, a wrench and a multitool. maybe 3 pounds of stuff, and i left it for the night. planning a 40 mile run in the morning, so i wanted some emergency supplies.when i wheeled it out the next morning, one of the three straps had ripped loose completely from the stitching. was just hanging there. keep in mind this was before i'd driven the bike at all, before i'd taken it over any bumps or anything.useless."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this bag is just what i was looking for. it is roomy enough for emergency tools and a patch kit as well as a compact tire pump plus my cell phone! i like the blue color as it matches my new bike too. being a larger bag it fits snugly between the upright and cross member and brushes against the water bottle holder. i was worried it might interfere with peddling however it does not. the only improvement i could suggest is making the velcro straps about a quarter inch or third of an inch longer to accommodate thicker cross members.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i like this aduro sport bicycle bike storage bag.my carbon road bike has a slightly awkward shape triangle, and nothing exactly fits inside, along with my water bottles.while this pack didn't quite fit either, i find a quite useful alternate mounting position that i very much like.i have it inverted on my top tube, just under the forward side of my saddle. unconventional location, but it fits perfectly, makes for an aero flow in front to my post, doesn't impede my pedaling, looks good too.the bag is well made, holds a tube, co2 inflator and 2 cartridges, allen wrenches, protein bar, and has some room left.the zipper is very smooth; but in my unusual configuration, it hangs down so i use a small bit of teflon coated copper wire to hold it up. probably no one else using this pack would need this workaround.i haven't ridden in the rain, so can't speak to that.i've had it in use for about a month and am very pleased."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"updated review:so i've had this item for just over a year now and it's falling apart! i've had to re-sew all the velcro straps but the underlying fabric is just coming apart.so..i added denim patches on the inside where the straps attach and sewed them to reinforce those areas... held for a little bit but the fabric is such crap (strands instead of mesh) that it's just falling apart around the patch!now.. the heaviest thing i'm carrying is small frame lock... along with my phone, a few allen wrenches, patch kit, etc.i doubt the entire bag & contents weighs even 5 lbs.waste of money!especially considering that my previous bike bag lasted more than 25 yrs! again it's only been one year.. maybe 150 days of riding!original review:i like the size, ease of installation and placement. time will tell how sturdy it is. my biggest qualm with the bag is that the yellow color is not what is represented. my monitor is excellently color calibrated and the yellow on the bag is more of a dull w/ slight green undertones as opposed to the vibrant golden/sun yellow in the picture."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought the bag to be able to stash my wallet and keys in while riding but wanted something slim i wouldn't notice on the bike. this bag fit perfect on my trek marlin 5. build seems okay, my only worry is the longevity of the velcro in dusty/dirty conditions but time will tell."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"as opposed to what others have mentioned, the straps actually do hold very tightly and i mountain bike very hard and rough on my bike. the people that said they were loose didn't know how to put the straps on properly. although to be fair, i'm not an engineer and had to call my engineer friend from work to show me how to strap them on properly (i felt extremely dumb even though i'm normally good mechanically). my pride and dignity aside, they don't strap on like any other strap i've ever put on, but they work perfectly!100% satisfied! just make sure if you have a waterbottle holder, that the dimensions of this won't collide. my bike's geometry does cause it to collide a bit, but practically speaking is not an issue. i couldn't find anything else on the market that was big enough like this one and actually worked well. would recommend"
5.0 out of 5 stars,bought for my wife for her charge fat tire bike to carry small items - mainly cell phone. the behind the seat bag on her road and cross bikes wouldn't work because of rear fender and lower seat height. this is much handier for her anyway. i'll probably get one for my fat tire bike too.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this unit might not be for you because it is fairly large but so far i have found it to be very good. i keep a hex head tool, canister inflater, tire removal levers, and patches in it as well as car keys. it has a net inside to allow one to minimally organize items. zipper is on the edge of the top for easy access when mounted. good quality material. and the velcro straps work well on my aluminum tubes. an added plus is the gap between the top tube and seat tube that accommodates the prong on my allen hitch-mounted bicycle carrier. my top tube is horizontal so you may not have such a gap on a sloped top tube. so far i like it the best of the carrier gizmos i've tried. if you carry a water bottle on the seat tube it will probably get in the way. i carry mine of the down tube."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"this item is sturdy and will likely last. however.1. one really can't open it when it is mounted.2. with my bike rack, the item must be removed to mount the bike (that's on me for not recognizing before purchase).3. the mounting bracket the attaches to the seat post immediately took paint off. i don't care given that my bike is roughly handled, but many would care about this.if i buy something similar again, it will be one of those little bags that hangs under the seat."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i’ve never seen such a poorly designed item that received 5 stars.here are the problems with it:1) the velcro straps are not suitable for small to medium diameter frame bars. if you try to install on a small diameter bar, the strap will wrap around so far that it won’t match up the velcro to the catchy part. this means you have to loosen the strap but then the bag moves around and isn’t secure.2) the velcro straps are reversed. they should have the ends wind up on the opposite side of where the zipper opens up. as it is, the strap ends dangle in front of the zipper and are a nuisance when trying to reach your hand in there.3) be warned that the “red” color is more of a burnt orange, not a true red.4) there was some messy stitching on this bag which is easily visible and i wouldn’t count on it lasting."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"disclaimer: i did have something heavy in the bag. however, it only lasted a week riding around a college campus with this heavy thing secured inside and all the velcro loops securely attached as they are designed to do. one of the plastic buckle-ish-things that hold the velcro straps together (i.e., the piece that makes the strap a strap) broke during a pretty normal ride. i hit plenty of bumps, but the bag has enough space to hold much more weight and therefore be studied in my opinion.speaking of space, it is quite roomy and attached quite well. it did not move around much, and i think with less than 3 or 4 lbs of stuff inside, it might hold up very well. i did not test its waterproofness. i liked the concept and design of the bag. i have made/modified many storage pouches for backpacks, tactical vests, web belts, etc., so i will testify that the materials of this bag are its killer. if you want something that will last and hold up to anything forceful or stressful on its components... this is probably not your bag. it is not durable nylon or plastic and the stitches are not very neat either."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"with much anticipation, waited for the color i wanted to get of this bag. upon mounting, realized it's quite large and roomy, which is great and all, but if you have any sort of water bottle holder? fuhgetaboutit! just won't fit right, and if you wedge it between the bottle holder, it will push it's way to the left of the frame, off center. to make matters worse, i was trying to adjust the fit, when one of the very thin plastic clips that the velcro loops through broke, making it sag even more, and making it worthless to me now. 2 stars because it's a nice bag with a lot of room, but cheap components to mount with. what a disappointment!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"the first thing i found out, after installing before a 45 mile ride (reason i needed a bigger bag) was that when mounted inside the frame, under the seat post, the vertical bottle holder on the seat post frame was not useable. so while i have 2 bottle holders, only the forward more angular one was useable. the bag is long and make even a short bottle a not worth it option. however, the bag does its job and holds a lot of stuff, and compliments an under seat (off the back) bag perfectly. used it to hold a couple energy bars, some gel chews, my phone... and when halfway i took my sleeves off and put them in the bag too. it was secure and didn't wobble around. so, a very good purchase, but the extra bottle loss can be a big deal to some..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag was delivered very quickly. it seems to be of good quality with strong velcro straps, sturdy fabric, and a smooth working zipper. it is easy to mount to the bike and stays in place perfectly. there is some stiffness to the fabric and gravity does the rest to keep it where it belongs. i hardly know it is there but it is large enough to hold my phone, lip balm, wallet, keys, sunglasses and room for more.bike clothes are not known for an abundance of pockets so this bag lets me take the items i need in a compact and secure manner.edit: i have had this bag for a year now. it is still as good as new even after 3000 miles of sun and rain exposure. it does fade a little but a treatment of '303 protectant' brings is back to new (temporarily). i now have a second one for my second bike."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i've had this bag for 13 months and i just replaced it with something else (it's seen ~2,000 miles of road time). still technically works, but it's starting to fail in the place i was initially worried about upon buying it... the top tube strap attachment points. i just don't think you can use this design with a bag with this much volume. either it gets filled with stuff that weighs it down, pulling at those attachment points, or you don't put that much in it, and it flops around, pulling at those attachment points. the bag i replaced it with has molle-type loops with separate velcro straps, which i feel does a better job of distributing the weight on the stitching."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"the color i received was nothing like the golden yellow that is pictured. instead, what i received is a pale faded out yellow with an odd neon green tinge. the packaging shows that sporty neon green color, the seller’s picture shows a rich golden yellow, and the product itself is neither color! i would’ve taken one color or the other but this is coloration is so appauling i can’t even stand it on my bike. now i get to experience the pleasure to return the item at my convenience because the seller is misrepresenting the product. the picture is a complete misrepresentation of what you will receive if you order the yellow."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"my biggest pet peeve is that it’s hard to center with the seat tube. it attaches to the frame fine and takes some trimming depending on your bike, but the attachment that secures to the seat tube is too far up on the bag, causing the bottom portion of the case to sway back and forth while riding, or just be lopsided. i only carry a tool, my lights and a small back up pump so it’s not a lot of weight. i would love to be able to fit my lock in there too but there isn’t quite enough room. i guess you get what you pay for, i just don’t like that sometimes it gets lopsided enough to where my foot and/or leg brush against it from time to time."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is exactly what i needed to keep clutter out of my pockets while riding. i can hold my phone, keys, wallet, and even sunglasses no problem. the only bummer is i have to detach this when putting my bike on my hitch rack when driving. other than that the three straps take little time to reattach. my rides are much more enjoyable without stuff in my pockets. i do not ride in the rain therefore cannot comment on weather resistance.**update** dec. 2020 - i have owned this for 9 months. the straps that attach to my bike frame are loose now. i took one star away because it could be sewn better. i am using safety clips now. eventually i will need to replace product as i feel it is not meant to last for years."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i just bought a $3k e-bike (electric bike), & have enhanced it with remote-controlled turn signals, a gps unit, & even custom-designed foot pegs! along the way, i've put together an entire set of tools to adjust everything. i was looking for a bicycle pouch that wouldn't get in the way of riding, & this pouch is perfect! took < 1 minute to install. only problem is that the fuller it is, the harder it is to open & close. however, because everything else is just right for my needs, only loses 1*.highly recommended, especially if you don't want bulky saddle bags poking out from the frame of your bike / e-bike!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"not a bad frame triangle bag. the velcro straps are long enough to go around thicker bike frame tubes and it sits fairly well on the bike with sloping top tube. not perfect, but not bad. the size of the bag is okay, and the volume inside is more than expected by looking at it... the way the velcro is mounted to the bag doesn't look like it will stand the test of time, but only time will tell. the material is okay for this price point. the bag is okay for this price point.better than nashbar's triangle bag... what a piece of junk that is... they use to sell good bags, but not anymore.we'll see how it holds up over time."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"bought this for an old schwinn road bike. the straps are long enough that when pulled tight they can not fasten. i have to double them around, and the hook and loop fastener is only making about a square centimeter of contact. i will probably cut the straps and sew them back on after removing some as it doesn't seem like this will be very secure on a bumpy road.the bag seems pretty low quality all around but sufficient for its intended purpose."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is pretty large. it has lots of room. it only seems to fit under the seat of my bike, the straps are not optional to place it on the front. the zipper is on the left side so you can only open it from the left because of how it has to be installed due to where the straps are. therefore, i have to get off my bike to get something out of it. it's a good bag however, the 2 things i don't care for are where it can be installed and the opening on the wrong side for me. otherwise there's plenty of room to put things in it. i'll get used to the downfalls."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought two of these in hopes that i could use on my bike and grandsons. unfortunately, because of where the bars are place and where the zipper opens they did not fit. but that being said, i wish they would have fit because they seemed very well made and if they would have fit, i would have liked them. didn't put them in a rain storm but the zipper seems very snug and the velcro adheres well for a snug fit on the bike. loved the colors as well. i could get it on the one bike but the zipper pointed down so if i would have stored anything in it, when unzipped it would have all fallen out. might be great for a mens bike but unisex and women's the straps are not placed to where it will fit. i returned and got a refund very quickly which says a lot for the seller!!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i was happy when i received and started using in july 2020, it's now september and bike pack is starting to fall apart. noticed a small hole developing after less than two months! would i order one again, maybe, if it was better built. if the developer/creator wants to make a better bag, use better fabric and stitching. may i also recommend that once you unzip this is one big bag, meaning no inside pockets or elastic to hold keys or hold clip.i would not order this product again without being reworked and of course it's too late to return."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"for what it is, a flimsy pouch, it's very much overpriced. it does the job, so it will work just fine for my needs. the velcro straps seem to be made for thicker frames and are too large for smaller ones. i had to give it some slack to properly secure the velcro and then i had to cute the end of the strap short. the item has a strong distinct petroleum based chemical smell, which is probably not safe in the long run. i suspect that this has to do with their waterproof coating. as long as you don't touch it too much and keep it on your bike, it should be fine."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i've ridden several hundred miles with the bag. my only problem is that it hangs down far enough that i can not get a water bottle into the holder on the seat tube. i have a large (60 cm) frame with a horizontal top tube. i'd guess everyone will have the same problem. however, it does hold tools, an inflator with spare cartridges, a couple of tubes, wallet, and phone. it has a nice inner pocket to help keep thing separated. it stays out of my way when riding, but is easier to access than a bag mounted behind the seat."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this bag for my wife's new specialized street-mountain bike to replace an old under-the-seat bag that interfered with a new rear light. initially i was worried that this new bag would not fit well in the frame at the seat post end because the angle was not 90 degrees. but, it did fit well, and is successful. the reason i don't give this 5 stars is that the velcro loops for attaching to the frame are really intended for round frame tubes. the new bike has a wide oval frame tube for the cross bar. it works, but this arrangement leads to some interference between the zipper and frame tube. realizing this, i can arrange the velcro to mostly keep the zipper away from the frame. i am still considering if i should add some friction tape on the frame, but i don't like the idea of the glue on the tape getting gummy in summer heat. the manufacturer should consider an updating the design to prevent contact between the frame and the zipper and accommodate non-round frame tubes. as a small aside, the purple trim on the pouch matches the deep purple frame color on the new bike."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased this bag to carry my on the road tools while i’m out on my bicycle, it works like a charm the straps keep it in place firmly i have not had to adjust once yet and i’ve had it for over a month on average i ride 13 miles per day.it’s currently carrying a mini bike pump, tire patches, and a bicycle repair tool, as well as my charging cord for my bicycle light. in addition to those things it was able to carry all of those items plus my phone, car keys and wallet with no issues.if you are planning on being a serious cyclist you will need to carry emergency equipment and tools and you would need a bag like this for your journey/adventures. i would highly recommend this bag, the material is nice and sturdy. i don’t ride in the rain but if i did i’m fully confident that the bag would not deteriorate.i hope you find this review helpful."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"if i had bought this for myself and used it to carry keys or my cell phone, then i'd give this a higher review as it does attach easily and does carry stuff that you'd rather not keep in your pocket. the trouble is that i bought this for my developmentally disabled brother. when my parents passed away and i became his guardian he was 272 lbs. i got him into a gym with a personal trainer, worked with a nutritionist to change his diet, and promised him a red trek electric bicycle (his dream) if he got to 199 lbs. he did it, but the bike is expensive, so i got him an expensive chainlock and this case to hold it. it fits in the case nicely, but after two weeks the straps started coming loose from the case. i fastened them back with stove bolts and they held nicely, but then the zipper broke and is just not repairable. i gave it two stars because i feel people who give one star lose credibility because they sound like mr. crankypants. i'm not cranky and i'm not saying don't buy this. just don't expect much from it."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought a couple of these because the reviews looked good, but am really not happy with them. few things i'd change:* the velcro needs to be shorter so it's possible to get it tight on the bike frame.* the seat tube velcro needs to be closer to the bottom of the bag to keep it from swinging.* the rear top tube velcro needs to be further back, again, to keep the bag from swinging* the three velcro pieces need to be centered on the width of the bag. as it is, the bag sticks out an inch further to one side of the bike frame because the velcro is offset."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i am a diabetic. when i ride, i need to take my blood testing kit, snacks, glucose gel packets, keys, id, money, and my phone—too much for comfortably stuffing in pockets. this storage bag holds it all comfortably. it is easy to put on and take off the bike so i can use it as a purse if we stop for a bite to eat somewhere. the fabric is tough—which is good, except that if i get the bag too full, my legs rub against it as i ride, so the rough fabric rubs my skin. newer versions could maybe have a smooth nylon outside layer? but all in all, this is exactly what i needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"a very nice bag perfect for larger phones. i have one with a 6 in screen and the bags easily holds the phone, keys, money, bike tool, and, in today's world, a mask and gloves. i could also add a puncture repair kit if i wanted. the bag seems well made. i have not tried it in the rain so i don't know how waterproof it is. the only possible downside to its size is that it restricts the size of water bottle that could be carried in the rear bracket to the very shortest ones. not a problem for me as i only carry one bottle."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i like the size of this case because it allows for a lot of stuff to carry and the zipper being on the top is nice to keep it from opening and losing stuff.my only comment is the velcro straps are weird in how they fasten. they are long, which is good because it accounts varying distances and bar sizes, however the way they fasten seems to be upside down. when i wrap, there is only a small surface of velcro that grabs, so not certain of how bumpy rides may affect the strength of grip."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"my first time having a bike since childhood and i was really excited to find this storage back. it's a great size to hold my wallet, gate opener, and keys. actually has a good bit of space where i could add a few more items if needed. it is not secure, however. if you are going to park your bike and run into a store or building you should take out the contents because there is no way to add a lock. even if you could lock it - it is easily removed from the bike so i would not suggest leaving valuables unattended in this pouch. serves it's purpose, sturdy and useful. i have not tried it in the rain so i do not know if it is waterproof or not. great find!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"so i’ve only had a short time but so far so good. 2 secs to put on and looks good. the mesh pocket separator within is a nice touch for cell phone or wallet. plenty of additional room for keys, etc. only negative is that to close or open the zipper requires 2 hands for me. i’d like to keep one hand on bike and open with other but no good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this order is waiting to replace the one in use already. its been over two years but i can see that the attach straps are on the verge of tearing loose from the bag itself. too bad. the bag is in a1 shape and if not for the straps could easily last another two years.its been a good bag for the storage of tools, oil, patches, extra tube etc etc.very good in wet weather. where i live showers are a givin.other than that its a good bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"what a neat storage bag fits great and really easy to use. nice color and that new nylon feel. the straps are easy to work with. but, made in china sucks when it could be made in the usa instead! that's another story. i also like the little fish-net pocket inside the storage bag. theres not much to say about a bicycle storage bag thats a triangle shaped as the official pictures shows. it is recommended and its really cool and i love it!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"looks nice. appears to be quite rugged. attaches very easily to a bike. lots of extra in each strap to go around thicker bars or compensate for different angles. stays in the middle. away from feet and legs. so far i have only put my cable bike lock and a small bottle of water (250ml) into it. but there is still more space, will have to get a small bike repair kit to add. will hold a 500ml bottle and a few other things. it can move around a bit when attached so if you bump it, it might go out of place, but won't detach. but as long as you don't touch it it stays where it is. and is easily nudged back into place. nice pouch. i'd say 4.5 stars, but it won't let me."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"looks cheap. made kind of cheap. the velcro straps get in the way of the brake cable. buy the ibera bag instead. it is much nicer. and the way the straps are sewn on the ibera, it does not interfere at all with the brake cable. i ordered both bags because i wasn't crazy about the orange trim on the ibera and wanted a purple bag to match my bike. but the purple aduro bag is going back. i can definitely deal with the ibera orange trim because the quality is so much better."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"first, let's just say that i, at almost 60 years old, am just taking up the sport of cycling. i need to get in shape. so i know very little about bicycles and accessories. second, i waited for a few weeks before i wrote my review to make sure that (a) my inexperience is a factor in the review, and (b) i wanted to try to give this a shot and have it work in a way not advertised.i knew that i needed to get something to store a few things in as i ride. while this looked like a winner, when i received it, i was unable to put where i expected under the seat, anchored by velcro straps for the crossbar and the seat bar (sorry is this is not how these are identified). my water bottle was in the way -- and it's not even close. i tried to put this only using two straps on the crossbar, but it flops around so much as to be distracting when i ride.i won't use this anymore, but i might find a friend who could use this if their water bottle were mounted on the diagonal bar. too bad, it does have good storage space for my large android phone, spare tube, and miscellaneous other things.the seller should note this in the product description somewhere so that others don't experience the same frustration."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"compact yet can hold essentials. inexpensive. gave three stars for water resistance because i have not ridden in the rain with it and do not intend to ride in the rain unless caught out there. two stars for security as there is none. does not lock and even if it did you just undo the velcro straps and by by. if they mean how it secures to the bike than four stars, your not going to carry a ton of weight in this. i intend to put small tools and maybe my cell phone, it is sufficient for that. it is out of the way and comes in a color that should match your ride. would buy again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"was planning a ""bike-packing"" trip with my son's explorer troop. needed additional storage space at hand so this was a nice addition to my set up. super easy to install and stays where you put it. enough space for a phone and charger, plus a small sunscreen, and a few bars for snacks. did not interfere with getting my mini-pump off the cross bar nor getting the water bottle out of the holder. got rained on and stuff inside stayed dry. got slopped with mud and it washed off easily with no damage to pouch. recommend!"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i've had this bag about 3 months. i ride my local mtb trails (houston, tx) about 3 to 5 times a week and use this to carry my multi-tool, phone, keys, and a sweat rag. not much weight at all. as you can see in the picture, the threads are coming loose from the front strap. i could see this happening if i carried my handgun in it and rode rough trails, but i don't. i may attempt to sew it back, but the velcro straps are starting to shred and i'd rather just get something better.if you aren't planning on riding trails or doing anything rough, this may be fine. otherwise, look at other options."
3.0 out of 5 stars,i bought this product originally for my mountain bike to replace the under the seat pouch. i thought i read that this came in multiple sizes and i was hoping it would fit. the product sent was way too large for my trek mountain bike with the water bottle holder in the same area. i wish this would have been smaller.i was however able to use it on my trek road bike but it does feel quite large on that as well
2.0 out of 5 stars,"this aduro sport bicycle bike storage bag triangle saddle frame pouch was almost good enough to use.i finally got a weekend to use my bike. i went to attach the bag... and one of the velcro straps ripped immediately, rightat the seam - see pictures.i inspected the rest of the bag and all else at least seems to be intact.overall, this bag got good reviews, but i'm not one of the happy customers at this point.now i must go through the return process and wait another week or so to attempt to attach the newbag when it arrives."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"biggest problem is that they punched the plastic multiple times, for multiple tags, through the main parts of the bags and so there are holes everywhere! my product came ugly with holes in it, and they didnt even punch the plastic all the way through so some are stuck forever inside your back to slide, make noise, and poke. also, definitely not water resistant. at least it will do it's job..."
3.0 out of 5 stars,to make the bag nice and snug against the frame there is only about a half inch of velcro left to make the connection and there is about 4 inches of waste that has to be cut off or it will be on the way. if you have a bike with thick tubes then this will probably be great but for a touring bicycle it almost doesn't fit. i'll update how well the half an inch of velcro does after a few months of use
1.0 out of 5 stars,"i returned this item. it could hold a fair amount of gear given the small size, but i could not figure out how to attach the bag to the frame securely and snugly using the oddly very long velcro straps. i may be wrong, but it seemed to me that the straps were a design flaw--there seemed no way to attach snugly so that the bag doesn't sag away from the posts to which it is attached. also, the construction of the bag seemed quite flimsy."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this seems well enough built. i will not be using the zipper too much i hope, so the highest wear item should last a long time. the same will be the case for the velcro straps as i have safe storage and will leave the bag on the bike.i keep a well stocked toolkit in it: extra tubes, 3 co2 cartridges, co2 pump\inflator, multi tool, tire levers, patch kit. there is still a little room for a couple energy bars.i will have to get a smaller water bottle as there is no longer room for a 22 oz. bottle on the seat tube."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i usually have two phones on me, my personal and work phone. one i put on my phone holder on the handlebars and the other goes in the bag. i usually also take my wallet and either my keys or my garage door opener. all of this fits comfortably in the bag with plenty of space for more stuff. during my last bike ride, my wife and i got caught in the rain. i ended up putting her phone, which is kept in a wallet holder type case, in the bag as well. everything fit and came out nice and dry. overall, very pleased with this purchase."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"big enough to hold wallet, keys, mobile phone, bike tools, and snack bar. straps hold pretty tight, and it hasn't come apart after several months of 60km weekend rides. so it does what it is supposed to do.big problem is that it definitely is not waterproof. not even close. heavy rain will leak in, guaranteed, and light rain will leave everything feeling a bit damp. wrap tools in plastic, and don't leave gloves or rags in the bag, and it will be fine.so, basically, it's meh... nothing special, but it works."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"cool little pouch, fits on the bike nicely doesn’t get in the way seems secure. i take it out a couple times and it holds keys phone little dog dish. my only complaint was its packaging. it had some plastic ties through the fabric that left permanent little holes in multiple spots. it works, it was an expensive, however the packaging needs to be redone. there’s no reason to put holes in something that supposed to be water resistant."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"purchased this to go on my dirt bike - i ride in the country (in texas) and was looking for a bag that could carry a gun, in all honesty. we have feral hogs, bobcats, mountain lions, etc. where i bike. this bag fits my 9 mm ruger, an extra clip, sunglasses, headband, hex key set and chapstick. (i am fully aware that a 9 mm isn't going to stop a hog, but it can make them wary of you) it is easy to access on the bike, and easy to unzip, but it also stays zipped - does not vibrate the zipper) very happy with this bike bag!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this storage bag fits great on my aero bike. it holds plenty of storage(iphone 8 plus with case, keys, wallet and room for more.) i even put a can of coke in it and there was still plenty of space. although it blocks one of my bottle cages. it doesn’t block my main cage with a 25 oz bottle. i was worried that the straps weren’t going to be long enough for my wide aero frame, but there was more than enough length. as well as the option to cut the straps shorter."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i received my purchase on time and it was exactly as described. the case is well made and the colors matched my bike perfectly. i was looking for this style and i do not believe i could have found a better one! the velcro straps were the right length for my trek frame. i would purchase again if i needed another bag of this type!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"not a problem on a bike but if left in the sun it starts turning purple in 4 weeks. it's still water tight and handy storage, but i mounted mine outside and it's fading after a month. most bikes would be stored in a garage so not a problem. mine is on a boat, sitting on the rail 24/7. if you want it for outside and want it to remain black, get a different one or try protective coatings to block uv.everything else about this product was great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag is great for riding. it definitely serves its purpose. it holds plenty of stuff and definitely does not get in the way of riding, which was my biggest pep peeve.on a personal note (there's nothing wrong with the product), i have a diamondback override mtb with a 20"" frame and i have 2 bottle cages, one for my actual water bottle and the other for my bluetooth speaker. the triangle bag gets in the way of my 1st water bottle cage, not leaving me any space for my water bottle. if i switched them around then the triangle bar muffles the hell out of the bluetooth speaker, defeating the purpose of the speaker.i've decided to keep it anyway, maybe i'll get another bike or just gift it to someone. i do like it though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased this frame bag mostly to hold extra stuff when i do rides over 50 miles. it fits securely on the frame with velcro straps that are long enough to accommodate any bike frame. any extra velcro can be cut off. the bag seems to be made well and it is big enough to hold my bike lock, iphone, gloves, energy bar and tire tools. i even stuffed a lightweight jacket in it once. for the money, you can't go wrong. it was shipped right away, packaged well and useable in a flash."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"nice size and utilization of bike frame space, zippered bag.would be better if the velcro attachment were for the full length at top of bag and possibly for the side of the bag for 2 reasons,strength and rigidity.had to replace this bag after a year of 3-4 rides a week.the velco attachment was ripping off becoming unattached.it can't hold the weight of a cable and lock and cell phone.the bike path bumps and the bags weight of not even a lb. of contents will cause tearing off from attachment points.also you can't unzip bag with single hand must hold stiff with one hand before you can unzip with the other,effectively restricting access once riding bike."
5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect bag for my road bike. most bags i tried on my road bike were too bulky and my legs would bump it while pedaling. this bag is large enough to fit my keys wallet and phone in but narrow enough that i don’t notice it’s there while riding.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this bike bag is the absolute worse wast of your money. not only is it not “water proof” but it’s strap system is very weak and the bag wabbles around all the time. for an average mountain biker you carry a multi-tool, psi gauge, mini pump, lock, your phone, a spare inner tube and more. well let’s just say your not getting away with that. the most you can carry is a multi-tool and you phone and even that’s too much. the bags straps that are made out of valcrove have already fizzeled to nothing and yesterday on my first ride with this bad one of the straps just completely broke and the bad was all in my legs causing a big safety concern. over all all this bag equates too is a great job for a trail worker to pick up because you can be sure it will fall of your bike. 20/10 would not recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"hey just bought this pouch off amazon, quality material!! although it’s a little large but it will work. the one thing that irks me about this product is.. when i secure it to the bike tightly, the zipper is in a terrible location. the zipper falls under the crossbar, also if your secure the straps tightly like i did, it makes it difficult to zip shut. otherwise it’s just a bag and it serves it purpose."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this is a terrific bag. i needed to lose a bike bag for a new garmin radar light and this bag fit the bill much better than anticipated. i an a long time avid cyclist and have used every kind of bag on various bikes. this is an inexpensive bag easily monts and fais on my cross bike with more storage than my seat. bags.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"bag has plenty of room for basic stuff that you would need: wallet or id, phone, keys. well made, will definitely stand up to long use. my only complaint? its too long to use a downtube water bottle holder on the bike. i have it on a trek verve2, with a 22 1/2” frame if that helps. pretty much the biggest “urban “ use bike they make. be careful with the velcro loops, they impede the brake cable if you have a bike that has exposed brake line. not a big deal, i used a stirring straw to cover the part that it touches. might not be a bad idea to include these in with the bag."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i got the smaller one but it is large enough to hold essentials and few other items. it would probably hold a bike lock, but as others mentioned, the velcro ties are loosely attached to back. they attach ok to the bike but look like they could tear off with a heavier load. overall looks good for light use and willing to give it a try. made in china."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i like this little bag, i got 2. easy to put on has little pouch inside, the only thing negative i have to say about it is it is a little bit large to fit on a girls bike. it just hardly has enough room to fit in that little area. at least on the bike we put it on. it will fit perfectly on the other bicycle, and it may fit on other girl bikes this one just has a spring located under the seat that makes it more difficult."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i tried to install this on my roadbike and it didn’t fit around the frame, there was too much strap material so i wasn’t able to tighten it down properly. my frame isn’t usually thin so i think this is a product design flaw beside that the bag it’s self seem like decent quality it fit all my tools( allen keys, chain breaker, tire levers) 2 new inner tubes and my bike pump which i was impressed with. another con i noticed was the bag seemed a little wide, like i would potentially rub against it while riding."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i received this bike pouch on time. installation was easy, it can fit on any bike, and it is big enough to hold phone, keys and lots of other stuff while biking. when i am not biking i place my gloves, velcro ties and what i used to hold the bike to the car carrier. i highly recommend it. this pouch is well made and looks like it will last for a while."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"bought this in july of 2019. put it on my hybrid bicycle to hold my phone, wallet and keys while riding. kept my stuff dry and enough room to hold my items. after about 1 year, the material around the tabs on the top started to rip. i emailed company 2 weeks ago but still haven't heard back from them. will not buy anything from them again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have been using this for over a year now, i think, and it works great for me, on my trek mountain bike.. it stays where it belongs, has enough room for most of the stuff i want to carry with me.. it has my bike lock in it. along with, my tire pump, and the power bank for my phone.... i think there are a couple other small items, and there is some room left over.. i would gladly buy another, if i needed one...."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag fits perfectly on my trek hybrid. if i had one issue (and it's minor) it would be that the velcro straps are a bit too long for my bike. i have to pull them as tight as possible to keep the bag secure. that said, i am using it to carry my cable lock so the weight in it is pretty heavy. you might not have the issue with a larger bike frame or if you're carrying lighter objects. i haven't tried it in the rain, so i can't comment on the water resistance. for me the size is perfect for the cable lock and a few other small items. overall i am very happy with this bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"fits perfectly on my bike, capacity larger than expected. i've had it on my bike for just under two months and it's holding up really well. use two hands when you're zipping it open or closed. i've had no problems. i had a flat on a back road and was sure happy that the repair kit, my mini air pump, along with other tools were easily accessible and fit inside the bag with no issues."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i liked the bag when i first got it and strapped it onto the frame of my mountain bike. nice size, room to throw a bike tool, phone, wallet, and windbreaker in comfortably. but the product is clearly not designed to be used on a mountain bike; fifth ride and the top stitching came undone completely. it's probably fine for low-impact road biking."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i'm not particularly crazy about this thing - nothing to do with the manufacturing which seems to be good quality, it's just not a look i like, but i didn't want something that hangs under the back of the seat and requires buying a new tail light. it's adequate for my cable lock, a spare tube and my combination tool, which is all i wanted it for.'nuff said."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"larger than expected. there should have been two mounting straps on the vertical mount to keep it from swinging around when hammering. i fit spoons, multi tool, tube, co2 inflator and extra canisters, with room for wallet and keys.straps designed for really fat tubing or large diameter frame construction. lots of leftover to cut, but not a lot of grip on smaller frame construction.i’ll keep it , but ordered something else that fits in a bottle cage."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love the bag. it's very spacious, and does not get in my way at all. it is big enough to hold my wallet, keys, cell phone, c02 tire inflater, and bear spray canister (i live in the pacific northwest). i never notice it's there when i'm riding. the only downside is that it will not mount to a woman's bike (step-through frame) in a practical way, so i had to find something else for my wife's bike."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag has lots of room to hold your important things, including a bike lock. it also fits securely to the bike. unfortunately, it's a bit too big in that it cramps up against a standard bottle holder on the lower part of the bike. it barely fits and, even then, usually i have to push the bag off a little to the side. it works, but i wish it were a tiny bit smaller."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i ordered black, and they sent me the red and black one. i waited too long to initiate a return, so now i’m stuck with this thing, and i really hate the red one. the bag itself seems like it would be handy, and it’s easy enough to install, though a bit bigger than i expected/wanted. if you don’t hate the 80s look of the two clashing colors then you’ll probably be happy with it. the color thing is really a bummer though. wish i had initiated an exchange before it was too late."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this storage bag fits perfectly on my 26"" schwinn men's deluxe suburban bicycle. the bottom touches the water bottle holder on the frame bar below it, so it couldn't be any larger. but i can easily unzip it while it's mounted and it fits my large cell phone, a small tire pump, tire patches, and a couple small bike tools, comfortably. i could stuff more in it, but it's quick convenience and keeps my cell phone out of the sun! it doesn't fit my wife's bike with the angled upper frame bar, unless there's a creative way to mount it i'm not seeing"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"we bought this for my 14yo son's bike so he could carry his phone while out with his friends without worrying about dropping it or it getting wet. it's the perfect size to fit all he needs (phone, keys, money), nestle well within the bike frame, and not interfere with his riding."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have a pump, tools, 2 tubes, and some bunges in here (that i use while on the bike rack). i could probably fit a poncho (i don't plan on riding long enough to ever get stuck in bad weather). but there's plenty of room. my favorite part about it, when i want to get low (more aerodynamic), its a great place for my knees to grip and stabilize me. not sure if that's the right thing to do, but that's how i roll."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"good quality, a little on the small side, but sufficient for my needs. i can fit a bottle of water inside, and the mesh pocket fits my note 4 phone no problem. i also keep my headlight battery pack and a multi tool inside. the zipper works well, the straps are plenty long enough for my top tube and seat tube. the angles of the tubes on my frame don't quite match the angles on this bag, so it doesn't have a good custom-fit look, but it'll do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,love this!! i use it on my walker. it fits nicely between the stabilizer bars and attaches to the top stabilizer bar and front vertical bar. holds my cell phone and small snack nicely. great to put silverware or scissors in so i can safely take where i need to. add some independence that i didn’t have before.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"cool little storage pouch. can’t beat it for the price. bought for my commuter road bike and works as designed what can i say it’s a bag. it’s pretty big too, but not big enough to look touring like. fits my air pump. gloves, patches, spare tube, cellphone charger, and a snack or two. with room to spare."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"seems fairly sturdy. given its size, i have just enough room for the bag and 1 water bottle, but not 2. note in photo that i routed the velcro straps under the rear break cable. seem ok, but hopefully it does not cause wear and tear on the cable or the bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i was surprised on how will this fit my small and extra small bike frames. after doing a few long rides and all kinds of weather i was pleased with how the bag stayed securely on the frame and the gear stayed dry. i wish there was a strap that attached to the down tube, but i can see how that would mot help in medium or larger frames. overall, worked great!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"provides adequate storage for phone, first aid and a few tools. it seems to be well made and should last. the only downside is that i have to remove it to put the bike on the yakima carrier since the bike is supported by the tube that the bag attaches to."
1.0 out of 5 stars,it’s a lovely bag however i will be returning it. the site said it would fit on any bike and it clearly will not work for mine. it is made for a boy’s bike that has a crossbar. i have a girls bike and there is nowhere on my bicycle that i can attach this to. i was so disappointed because this is very well made and the velcro tabs hold securely.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this pouch to replace a storage container that mounted above my rear tire. the new pouch is a clever design, it occupies space in the bike frame that's otherwise dead air. most importantly it does not block visibility to my rear-facing safety light. the size is perfect for my needs. it holds my wallet, phone, and car keys with space to spare. i was concerned it might inhibit access to my frame-mounted water bottle while riding, it does not. i have zero complaints."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"holds a decent amount of supplies. i use it with another case that holds my phone and charger. last trip i was able to fit keys, a hat, candy bars, wallet and a few other smaller items. it is waterproof and easy to install. exactly what i was looking for. definitely would recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i love the bag. it fits on the bike nicely. it’s great for cell phones, cable lock, lights, etc. looks to be good quality. the only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the zipper. it unzips from the bottom. things can fall out from that corner. it’s needs to zip from either direction or at least unzip from the top. that way you wouldn’t have to unzip all the way and your stuff would not fall out."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is better and bigger than i was expecting. you can fit phones, tubes, wrenches, wallet, a lot, a lot is what you can fit into this bag. i even put my water bottle into it for a ride bc my bike doesn’t have a bottle mount. it’s easy to install, spacious and so far seems well made and durable. i don’t think you can go wrong with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bicycle pouch arrived in good condition, installed easily and does everything i expected it to do. it does not get in the way while i'm riding my bike and carries all the items i need while on the road. my garage door opener, identification and cash all fit in the pouch and there is room for additional items if needed. the zipper opening is located so it can be accessed without removing the pouch from the bike, but if i am leaving the bike somewhere where i can't see it i can easily remove the pouch and take it with me."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"picked this up to put my keys, wallet and phone under my road bike. i've done a few 10+ mile rides with it and it's hardly noticeable. there are times where it seems to stick out every so slightly causing me to rub against it, but it doesn't happen frequently enough to take it off. i feel that may be from a lack of ""breaking in"" on my part, anyway."
5.0 out of 5 stars,works great! it can fit bike tools and 2 inner tubes easily. i could also put my wallet and phone in it as well! there's not really any security features. you just velcro strap it to your bike and there's a zipper. seems pretty water resistant!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the storage bag easily attached to my bike with the velcro straps. though the size isn't super large, you can easily store you main essentials like a phone, keys, wallet, power bar, and water without interfering with your legs. the only con is that a wish the zipper was on the side and not the bottom. it makes it hard to get stuff out without having to first get off your bike."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"wrap the velcro straps on a bike with 1"" frame tubes and the two velcro sides that have to mesh don't line up. as is, the bag cannot be attached to the frame of the bike. i am not sending it back, however. i will remove about an inch from the middle of each strap each strap and resew the velcro to the new position.upon learning of the problems i had with their product, entronik. issued a full refund for the cost of the bag and shipping. with the straps modified by my wife, the bag proved quite satisfactory."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"was looking for a good, affordable storage solutions for bike necessities, and this is exactly what i needed. the bag is very large, yet not bulky enough to be in the way of anything. i'm hoping it holds for a few years, but from what i see, the materials are of pretty decent quality, so hopefully that won't be an issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i needed a new storage compartment for my bike. i had outgrown my old one, or at least my cellphone did. this one was actually a bit bigger than i expected (tbf i didn't bother to measure). this one has plenty of room for a phone, wallet, keys, and a multitool. its almost too big. its right against my water bottle but neither seem to mind."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a very nice bag but i could not give 5 stars, only because the velcro is not exactly the length it needs to be for perfect fit. i stitched a piece of velcro onto the bag so i could make it much more secure and not be able to rock from side to side as i ride. it also would help if there was a zipper or larger separator inside to divide tools from electronics (scratching)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"love this bag. problem: i live in portland and it rains all the time. everything inside which is cloth gets soaked. otherwise good product. has a lot more space than anticipated. keep the follow inside it: inner tube, tool kit, lube, chapstick, gloves, scissors, and patch kit. plenty of extra space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,my bike already had handlebar and under-the-seat bags for various supplies. i needed another bag to hold a fresh shirt for long hot rides or a windbreaker for rides that start off cool in the morning but heat up as the day wears on. this bag is perfect for that use. it fits perfectly on my bike frame and is the perfect size for holding a folded up shirt or windbreaker. it secures well to the frame and adds very little weight to the bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,no complaints here! wanted something to keep my phone and other small items in. product is bigger than what i was expecting which is fine by me. i actually keep a 12-16? oz poland spring bottle in there as i don't have a water bottle holder on my bike. 🖒🖒
5.0 out of 5 stars,"perfect to carry up to two wallets, two phones, keys, and a pair of glasses. it’s just what i was looking for! compact, well made, just enough room for the essentials. no more back pack to carry a few little things!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"we don't ride a ton so i can't speak to the longevitity / durability, but so far we're pleased with this pouch. plenty of room for phone, wallet, and much more. the interior pocket is nice, to keep things from bumping into each other (we place phone in pocket)fit great on an adult male bike. probably wouldn't fit a female bike."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"my hub got a new bicycle that he has been riding regularly, and was caught in the rain, with his cell phone on the bike, he had to find shelter so that the phone wouldn't get wet. i immediately hunted this down for a christmas present. he loves it, it doesn't get in the way while he's riding and since it's waterproof, he can easily slip his phone and other small items into the pouch and be confident that all will be safe and dry."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"your browser does not support html5 video. wow, i was pleasantly surprised by this lightweight yet effective storage bag. it held my iphone xr plus my keychain with multiple keys and hand sanitizer with still more space to fit more things. it conveniently sits under my bike seat so it doesn’t get in the way while i bike. i chose this over a phone mount & regularly have my airpods playing my spotify playlist while my phone is safely stored in this bag. highly recommend!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is big enough to store my wallet, keys, pepper spray and a tightly-rolled light jacket. it’s easy to access as well with the zipper being along the top and off to the side. the only thing is that i had to kind of smush it into place above my water bottle holder; it’s a bit large for my bike frame. but even so, i made do and it looks great!worth every penny!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"ok, this is kind of a no-brainer and i certainly don't fault amazon or the manufacturer for this, but i transport my bicycles using a rack that hangs the bikes from the top tube of the bike, so this storage bag interferes with my car rack. i, therefore, don't use this bag. seems well-constructed and unobtrusive otherwise, though."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"small and does not get in the way but big enough to carry a mini-pump, travel card, some cash, smartphone and a few crucial tools and a spare inner tube. requires two tubes to fasten to so will not work with all frame geometries"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"sometimes in life, it's the simple things that make all the difference. what can i say about this bike bag that hasn't been said by so many other happy customers? so far, i have been using it almost daily for 15 months, in all 4 seasons (yes, even in winter). not only does it carry and protect lot's of essentials, but it even makes my bike look better. the bike seems naked without it. whoever designed this deserves a medal of recognition. i just can't think of anything not to like about this bag. anyone who rides a bicycle should have at least one of these."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a cute little storage area that doesn’t get in my way. it will hold glasses, keys and your phone easily. (fits my iphone7). i would want to over fill it since it is on the frame just below the seat and would probably bump your legs when you pedal. i really like it and feel safer having my phone ride there than in the basket which can allow it to bounce out."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"just installed, so no durability info as yet. the bag itself seems solid, is spacious, but like at least 1 other review on this site ... the velcro straps are much too long. mine is a specialized road bike with largish aluminum tubes and to give you an idea .. i'll be cutting about 2"" off the straps to make them fit. seems excessive, thus 1 star off."
4.0 out of 5 stars,it’s a great bag end for me it actually had a little too much space and was a little larger than i needed but for many of the extra space would be welcome. i do wish it had a second outside zipper space even a thin one but overall it was a very good product
1.0 out of 5 stars,"seriously, who the hell decided the straps needed to be this long? there isn't a way to tuck the extra slack. i'd have to cut and resew them just to get rid of the excessive length. the bag itself feels cheaper than i was expecting. i also hate that the zipper opens on the left side, but that's just me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag fits perfectly on my bike, even with a water bottle holder! the best part is that it fits so many items in there and the zipper ensures that i don't lose anything along the way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i saw reviews about straps not being long enough and frayed fabric inside near the zipper area. neither was an issue for me. it holds all my first aid stuff and i even put a coiled bike lock in it. held everything no problem. i have a specialized road bike and the bar i strapped it to was definitely not skinny. perhaps improvements have been made.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag can hold a lot. i'm able to store plastic grocery bags, my wallet, my keys, my phone, my mask, and there's still room. despite all this storage capacity, it doesn't look bulky. it looks like it goes naturally with the bike."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this storage bag holds more than my small saddle bag hanging from the bike seat. also, it doesn't obstruct the seat post from attaching a blinking red led light for safety purposes riding on busy streets. i carry a cable and lock, iphone and a small flat tire kit with room to spare."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag has an excellent amount of space and fit well to my bike. initially i was stoked with this purchase, as the main reason i bought this was to carry a few bike maintenance tools and my kryptonite lock (which is a hefty lock). all was good for a couple of weeks. however, i started to notice a good bit of wear around the attachment points of the bag. the stitching was fine. it was the material that the straps were stitched to that was failing. now the bag shifts around a lot and is quite annoying to ride with. it's lightweight but not durable to daily use carrying anything heavy. overall it's a good bag for the price, as long as you don't plan to carry much weight with it daily. i also forgot to mention that it got rained on and all the contents inside were soaked. just keep that in mind."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this bike storage bag to hold my binoculars. you see, where i mostly ride is on a river trail where there is plenty of wild life. i keep my binoculars handy for when i spot interesting critters. the bag is very well made and fits the binoculars perfectly. that's not to say it will fill all binoculars since there are many that are larger than what i have, but it's perfect for mine."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i bought is to hold bike tools in case of a breakdown on the road. it is perfect size sturdy and the way it mounts it is easy to install and remove. has ample room for the necessary bike tools. it is out of way and you do not know it is there. would definitely recommend and would buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the aduro sport bicycle bike storage bag is durable, stylish, and functional. it has a high-quality construction and plenty of storage space for your cycling essentials. furthermore, i appreciate the variety of color choices that allowed me to match my road bike's color scheme perfectly. overall, it is easy to access, mounts securely and quickly, plus it will keep your items safe while you focus on your ride."
4.0 out of 5 stars,i feel that the bag is nicely made but i have a road bike and the straps are too long and do not have a tight grip with velcro straps. if i cut the straps then strap wont work. probably made for larger bikes. i just wont valuables in this bag in case it falls off.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i was a little skeptical about this actually fitting in the inside corner of my bike frame with the water bottle, but it is absolutely perfect! it is a nice tight fit with the looped velcro straps and takes up no more space than the frame itself. i am very impressed. now i can ride with my phone safely tucked away instead of in my pocket."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"the velcro is too long & hangs over so that your legs rub against the rough part while riding. the bag is too wide & you constantly brush against it while riding. you can try & attach it the the front of the frame but it’s designed for the back. it can fit your phone & keys but it can’t even fit a plastic water bottle. unfortunately, my roommate threw out the packaging so i’m stuck with this."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"good quality product for the price and easy to install. if your brake cables run along the frame make sure to run the straps between the cables and the frame to avoid tightening your cables.i use it to hold my repair kit and a co2 pump. i take out one star out because it doesn't have a rigid frame and tends to lose its nice shape when heavier objects, such as a cable lock, are placed in it. i highly recommend it for lighter objects."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great bag. very durable. survived a week of roughmountain biking in moab utah with no issues. rained a bit as well as crossing creeks and pounding puddles and everything stayed dry.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i like this saddle bag. i am able to add a lot of small items including tools, power bank to charge my phone or wireless headphones and any other small items. it does attach to the bike in the area of a second water bottle. if you don't have a second bottle holder this fits great but not so much if you do have another bottle holder."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i really like this little thing. you don't normally think of your bicycle frame being a usuable space, but this makes it usuable & doesn't interfere with the function of the bike. great for storing a phone, keys, wallet, tire pressure gauge, etc. while riding."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this item is a waste of time. the first thing i did after receiving it was throw it in the trash. material is really thin and you cannot see this in the pictures, but having it on your bike means that both of your water bottl mounts are useless. i don't usually like to go on somewhere and be so negative, but in this case it is warranted! buyer beware!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i haven't used it for mountain biking, but it seems sturdy enough for that. if it fits your frame for road biking or commuting i really see no reason not to buy this though. the only thing i dislike, and this is being picky, is that sometimes my leg rubs against the excess velcro, but my bike frame is very skinny so this shouldn't be a common problem. it's a little difficult to close while riding but you're not really supposed to do that anyway, so i see nothing wrong here."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the product was delivered on time. the bag is well constructed and holds essential tools for flats. including co2 inflator, extra cartridges, chain tool, spare master link, tire wrenches, multi-tool, wallet and cell phone. there remains room for more items. this is the medium-size bag and the zipper is well-placed to open it quickly."
1.0 out of 5 stars,product looked and felt nice. sturdy material and construction.does not fit on a lg frame bike that has a water bottle cage. the two do not work together and water wins over storage anytime.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a well made and durable bag - it fits my husband bike perfectly... mine, no so much. if you have a women's bike make sure you take measurements to see if it will fit. it will technically fit on mine but i will have to remove the bottle cage that i already have on. from another reviewer, it looks like the bag does not fit at all in some cases. just measure your bike before you buy! overall it is still a great product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this on the positive reviews but didn’t realize until i got it that i had no room for it on my frame. so i installed as a “mini-pannier” on my rack instead and couldn’t be happier. the zipper is to the side and easy to access and has lots of room. it’s great for casual riding when you want to carry a wallet, phone, glasses, etc. if the manufacturer would shorten the velcro straps for a rack, it could be easily sold for both applications!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,this bag works great. it has a large capacity. it doesn’t get in the way when peddling.i have a 21 inch frame and it fits great.i bought my wife one and it’s a really tight fit on her bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,i settled on this one after trying two others. i have it on my 10 speed mounted on the cross bar and the front neck. this way it does not interfere with my leg motion. not a lot of storage but works well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great bag, i've seen reviews saying that the velcro isn't strong enough, but i put a heavy kryptonite chain lock in it and have never had any issues, i've had it for almost 3 years and would highly recommend it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this pouch is very handy to store my keys, wallet and cell phone while riding my bicycle. i would recommend to anyone that rides bike and does not want to carry anything in their pockets. it just makes riding so much more comfortable. i'm very happy with the purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i’m very happy with this storage pouch, it has a good amount of room and fits snugly on my bikes frame. i have it 3 stars for security because it can’t be locked or otherwise secured, but i didn’t buy it for theft deterring. it’s a great pouch."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"the idea around a triangular zipper pouch velcro attached is great but the materials left a lot to be desired. mine arrived with scuffs and pierce marks, more like the cheapest chinese backpackyou may find in downtown la . so i sprayed it with some waterproofing compound to make it stiffer, then added firm foam from some offroad lights to make some sort of structure and compartments inside. it will do the job but really it does not worth more than 2 or 3 bucks."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"nicely designed. large enough to fit a flat kit, phone, wallet plus more, while the bag itself does not interfere with my riding, nor the water bottle cage. it's stable and have been in place for over 300 miles now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,it’s a cool little bag and works as intended. happy with purchase. check out the dimensions in advance to make sure you have room left for your other gear. there is no security. it’s just a zip bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a really nice bag to keep a compact tool, first aid kit, and other items you may need while on your commute or on the trail. it was very easy to mount, and stays in place. it does get in the way of my lower mount for my water cage, but that is a trade out i can live with. would recommend it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"you get what you pay for. very poor quality all over. zipper, material, flimsy, velcro, etc...the whole thing is very poor quality and it looks very cheap..as it is. design is also terrible. returning!.. paying for something little better next time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i wanted this bag to hold the controller for my e-bike conversion. so far it has worked out perfectly. it’s big enough to hold the controller and extra wires and small enough not to interfere with the battery, which is mounted in the water bottle holes. it’s seems to be of good quality. i’m pleased and would recommend this bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i do some occasional day biking and don’t want to wear a backpack through the woods. this item is perfect for iphone, keys, repair tools, and other incidentals that you might need."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice little bag. it was a bit larger than i thought it would be, but there was plenty enough room for this bag and my water bottle below it. this bag was so surprisingly large that it easily fit my spare inner tube, mini pump, and still have room for snacks."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag is very sturdy and the straps hold the bag securely to the bike frame. i have mine on a pedego city cruiser and use the internal pouch for my phone charging cable. the pouch as enough room to hold my bike tools, and co2 ultraflate tire inflator as well as my wallet. although i have not had to i would remove it when i lock my bike up. it is very convenient and the zipper function has been flawless."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this thing lasted maybe 3 months on mtn bike ridden 3x per week and two top straps broke. i catch ""urban air"", do great wheelies, and ride 20% dirt single track (take what you can get), so if you are lucky enough to do real mountain biking all the time, this won't last you a month. probably good for street rider."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"one velcro strap broke less than 5 minutes into my ride. the second velcro strap was holding on by threads a few minutes later. i had a spare tube, co2 cartridge and inflator, multi tool, wallet, and phone in the bag. i feel it should have no problem holding essentials without a complete failure."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i can stick my phone, wallet, keys and so much more in my bike pouch. it comes in handy when i’m biking and don’t want to carry items in my pockets. easy to secure everything."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the product works as advertised. i had an under seat bag prior to this that required me to pick and choose the gear i could bring on the ride. this product allows me to empty my pockets upon arrival and place it in the bag. in addition, i ride now with a multi-purpose bike wrench, air pump and patch kit should the unthinkable occur with room to spare."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"large carrying capacity. i can easily fit my wallet keys phone and some tools in this bag with space to spare. the internal mesh liner is great for separating scratch prone items, like my phone, from everything else. i use a large u lock, but if i used a cable style lock it would fit here quite easily. a real bargain for the price. i would have been happy paying $30 for it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is great. it holds quite a bit and i hardly realize that it is there while riding! the straps do an awesome job holding it firmly in place. if you’re looking for a bag to fit on the frame, you can definitely purchase this one with confidence. (i did go over the lettering with a sharpie on mine 😎)"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"avoid this productit does not hold well on the bike frame. constantly swings back and forth interfering with peddling. the straps (all 3) do not hold tightly, and are way to long with nowhere to put the excess, so they scratch you while riding. basically, between the bag swinging, and the excess straps scratching you this bag makes it unbearable to ride the bike!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"how it mounts and its size it just right for my use. i thought it a little odd that the zipper is on the left instead of the right, being most people are right handed, but no big drawback. i did not like the big brand-name logo put on it, and the biggest dislike to the pouch, and i put some black ink to the logo to at least dull it out, being it distracted from the looks of my bicycle, in my opinion. i don't like bill-boarded brand names on products."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i finally got an opportunity to use this product on a 10 mile bike ride yesterday it fits my keys my phone and a couple other assorted items and it kept it secure and it sat right above my water bottle. it is absolutely perfect for my needs and i would recommend it for anyone who has to carry essentials while riding
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i needed a place to put essentials (phone wallet keys and water) while riding, and it's very out of the way with this pack. it's able to hold a regular sized water bottle without much trouble, though i don't think that's what it was even meant for. great pack!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this bag. it is made of great quality, holds all my tools, and phone with room to spare. it fits perfectly on my bike. it was bigger than i anticipated but it fit my bike snugly and the zipper is to the side of the straps so it is easily accessible."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"got this so i could empty pockets on bike rides keep id , air pump and contact case still room for more no problem with any interference with legs while pedaling"
5.0 out of 5 stars,ordered this bag for my roadbikeonly ordered one but they sent and charged me for two but they were so nice i didnt even bother sending one backordered it in blue but also got a black one that looked way better on my roadbikeif ur looking for an affordable nice frame bag for ur bike to ad a lil storage you cant really go wrong with the aduro triangle strap on
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i was worried it would be too big, it is not. my lock fits in the bag, with my cell phone, and a wrench. it streamlines with the bars above, behind and below. thus my legs are never going to hit the bag when i peddle and fly down the bike path. one last thing, it looks like i picked the perfect color as well."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"after installing the first bag, i noticed a seperated seam on the bottom edge. amazon quickly replaced the bag, and the new one is in much better condition. it's held up well on several rides, but it does take some adjustment to fit the frame properly."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i like everything neat and tiddy. my issue with the aduro bicycle storage bag is that it slips forward and downfrom the position in the picture. this could be fixed if the velcro straps were attached closer to the apex of this 90 degree triangle. the bag slips out of position because the back side of the velcro straps can't get a grip on the shiny surface of the top tube and seat tube. picky, plcky, plcky, lol"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i ride my bike into work nearly everyday. this little pouch is great for holding my simple cord/lock, wallet, cell phone, and keys. if you are looking to tour de france or cross country and this will carry heavy gear, you picked the wrong underslung baggie. i especially like how easily i can access the pouch through the zipper while i am pedaling."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this thing went on my bike great, but one of the strap buckles broke a week after i got it. i managed to replace the buckle with a small carabiner i had and secure it back to the bike...then a week later the zipper split open. total waste of money. if it wasn't such awful quality it would be great. but it's useless after you use it a couple of times and it starts falling apart."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"storage bag is very handy especially for long rides. it's easy to fit multiple items within the frame bag. the bag allows one to store enough essentials like small snacks, a phone, wallet and some spare bike tools. the only negative i can point out is that the bag isn't all that waterproof, so i would suggest placing water-sensitive items within a plastic bag inside the storage bag. stitching doesn't seem too bad; only time will tell how it holds up."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i wanted a small bag that was out-of-the-way that could carry my cell phone and my wallet. this is a good-looking bag that seems well-made and holds my iphone x max and my wallet easily.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"fits great on my road bike and my wife's cyclocross bike, doesn't fit on my triathlon bike, but that's because of the frame shape of the bike. has a little mesh pocket to hold phone, wallet, or whatever you wanna put in it. made carrying tools easier"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"they cycle storage bag is nice. however, it is intended for a male’s cycle. as such, it doesn’t fit exactly as intended. still, i confident in security of fit."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i have bought this storage bag and have installed this weekend on my byke.it feeted perfectly on it, looks nice and now i have extra storage to grab a few things in my rides.the quality of the products did satisfied me. recommend to all."
4.0 out of 5 stars,nice product. looks good on my bike. i can fit my keys and a water bottle and a few other small objects. but you cannot zip it closed one handed. if you open it while riding you will probably have to stop to zip it close.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i've been using this storage bag for several times on my bicycle outings. the capacity is good, and the zipper keeps everything securely stored. the 3-point strap keeps the bag on the frame well. the width does not imped leg movements, but the bag does contact the water bottle that i also placed on the frame. i am happy with the bag and would buy again if needs arise."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a nice roomy bike bag. i can get my keys, phone, vape, wallet, bike repair tools in it and still have room! the only thing is, it might be to big for a water bottle on the lower part of your bike with this bag. if your trying to grab it out with the bag on, its pretty hard to do while riding. i usually have to pull over to take a drink because i cant pull it out or put it back in with the bag on. overall i like the bag, but i probably will use a different one if i plan on riding all day and drinking without stopping during my ride."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great for spare tube and bike tools. check the size and where the water bottle holder hits. it works on my son’s 26.5” bike but it’s a snug fit. i have to remove it prior to placing bike on our bike rack. overall, gets the job done!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,not for heavy items. i filled the bag with a spare tube and tools. after a few weeks one of the velcro loops simply tore out. replaced it with the following:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b079hqsc8s/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=utf8&psc=1rockbros 100% waterproof bike bag triangle large cycling tube pouch quick release frame bag 5lno problems so far - much sturdier construction.
5.0 out of 5 stars,it appears it will work well. less functional because of my bottle cages. not certain about weatherability in the rain yet. there are no locks. it is very accessible.
5.0 out of 5 stars,have really enjoyed having this storage bag on my bike. easy to install. holds my iphone and car keys easily. lots of room inside the case. quality is good.
4.0 out of 5 stars,had it for about 3 months and it was fine. now the zipper broke. i guess it’s cheap enough that no one should expect real quality.amending my review since i have now fixed the zipper on my own. no big deal. the bag is very useful for carrying small items. only down side is that i have to take it off to load the bike on my rack (a tow hook rack).
3.0 out of 5 stars,the bag looks and feels fine although it is smaller than i pictured. the straps for connecting are not long enough to fit my bike. it is built for the normal round tube framed bike and mine is not.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag has good storage capacity, but the zipper sits uncomfortably close to the hook and loop straps, making it awkward to use. upon first use, the zipper skipped and had to be forced open. i don't foresee it lasting more than a few weeks with how much i plan on using it.in short:pros: good storage capacity and easy to installcons: poor build quality, and hook and loop straps had to be cut shorter to prevent about 2 inches of excess."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a good storage bag. i use it to store my phone, tools and spare inner tube when i go on long rides. i made this purchase after i went on a 20 mile ride and ended up walking five miles after a nail punctured my rear tire."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i attached this on my 2010 schwinn ranger and it's great. my smartphone (5.5"" galaxy note 5), wallet and first-aid kit fit in well with a lot of room to spare. awesome buy and i love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i needed this to hold my cell when out for a long ride. it fits nicely within the frame with very little fabric extending beyond the frame tube.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i ordered 2 of these bags for my handcycle. they just arrived today and i transferred all my tools, spair innertubes, goo, etc and have lots of room left for snacks or whatever. they fit perfectly between the drafting bumper and the frame."
1.0 out of 5 stars,mine fell apart after only maybe 8 rides. straps broke and i had to carry it back for a good 5 miles while steering with the other hand. not ideal
5.0 out of 5 stars,"neatly tucked in the frame. easy installation and great to store wallets, phones, and keys when biking. fits small 8oz bottles too (tight)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"fits my phone, multi tool and spare tube. the only thing is that the water resistance isn't the best... left it out in the rain one night and the things inside got pretty wet. probably can take light rain"
2.0 out of 5 stars,plastic buckles broke within a month. waste of money. i emailed customer service and they replied 2 weeks later asking a useless clarifying question and then haven't responded since then.
5.0 out of 5 stars,good product that arrived pretty quick. my bike has a bit larger frame size but this fit fine. quality of the materials is not an issue but i've only had it a week or so by now and just a few rides but would recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great place to stow my phone, wallet and emergency tool. don't even notice it's there when riding. highly recommend it to anyone trail riding"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag is good. a little bigger than i expected. i have an extra small women's road bike and the bag does not allow enough room for my water bottle. no big deal for me, i'll have to find another place for a water bottle. i use the bag to carry a very heavy lock. so far, for the several days i've been using it, it's been holding up well. i think it will continue to do so."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"like this for spare inter tubes, gloves, pump, stem tightener etc. and it easily transfers to another bike. just getting into biking and have ""learned"" the value of spare parts after a couple of flats. now that i have the parts on board, no more flats....go figure ; - )"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i've got an older raleigh m40 and it fits very nicely and holds my cell phone, identification, and personal protection i.e. pew pew."
5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect fit for my husband’s bike. looks nice and sleek and flush to the frame. more storage than i imagined.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"sometimes, you just need a place to put items besides your pocket. very handy. i was able to fit a run of the mill disposable plastic water bottle in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this little storage bag did not disappoint. it attaches securely, has plenty of room for my phone and keys, a packet of tissues, with room to spare."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this little pouch is well made. i am not able to use it because it just doesn't fit on the mountain bike the way i had hoped it would - which is no fault of the product - just make sure you have enough room for it and it will not be interfering with any cables, etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i was skeptical if this would suit my needs or not, it has with each of my concerns! would it stay in place - yes. would my legs rub against it - no. would it be to big/small - no. would it hold my sidearm securely while riding, giving me immediate and easy access if needed - yes. i give this item an easy 5 stars!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i found the bag to be a bit wide, causing it to constantly brush up against my leg while riding. hard to attach, and placement in general is just awkward. offers a good amount of storage, but i think saddle bags that attach under the seat are better."
3.0 out of 5 stars,it's much smaller than the picture. and more difficult to store things in it due to it's design. good luck getting a phone in it. if you are lucky that about all you'll get in there. would not recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"purchased for my son's birthday. he received it on time and reports to me that he really likes it. i liked the design, as i don't care for under saddle bags that much. i may get one of these for my bikes and remove my seat bags..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i love this it fits on my bmx bike and it works well i do wish there where more pockets for stuff but still is a great item
5.0 out of 5 stars,this seller is outstanding!! both my bicycle items arrived in quick time and in perfect condition. the bike storage bag allows me to put all my pocket stuff in there and leaves me with less discomfort when riding. love this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it is a little hard to say if the color comes out right, pictures vs product, but the size/shape/weight of the bag itself is ideal for most rides: keys, phone, gloves, etc. all for fine w/plenty of room to spare, and the internal net makes accessing small items while riding super-easy!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i use this storage bag on my raleigh venture 3.0. it is ideal for carrying my cellphone, id and basic bike tools. bag was very simple to attach to bike frame and does not interfere with pedaling."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a very handy storage tool for your bicycle.not sure why ""security features"" is an option here, it's just a zipper, but it works very well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the medium bag fits my small bike frame (48"") perfectly. it's narrow enough that it doesn't get in the way, but holds a decent amount of gear. seems to be well constructed. the three velcro straps hold the bag securely. (still have room for one water bottle on the frame.)"
4.0 out of 5 stars,i’ve had this on my bike now for a couple months. it’s still holding on good and no signs of coming apart. the only issue i have is zipper placement. it’s very close to the bar so it makes it a little bit of a pain to open and close. not a big deal though. i’d buy it again.
1.0 out of 5 stars,this bag is made rather cheaply. i've been riding with mine for about 2 months and the straps have just about ripped off. luckily i saw it before my last ride so it didn't rip off during one of my ride's. unfortunately i just passed my return window.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"a little bigger than was expecting, but does not interfere while peddling. did not like my under-the-seat bag and always was just a little too small. have lots of space now."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"+ room for tools, spare inner tube, raincoat, etc.+ light weight+ fits well- zipper seam ripped after a few months of use- be careful to avoid brake cable on some bikes"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great storage bag. secures very tight against the bicycle frame. i have a full travel size first aid kit, 2 patch kits, an air gauge and a bike multi-tool, and i still have room for more items. definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very spacious and rugged bag....and the best part is that it's about half the cost of a typical ""bike store"" bag"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to install obviously. i have plenty of room for my bike tool kit, misc wrenches, phone, wallet, a few little extras if needed. also can fit water bottle, its tight on my mg hitch but it fits."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great for storing bike tools so the pressure is off your back especially if you plan to have a back pack while riding.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"the stitching on the attachment points is extremely low quality, came unstitched after one ride. would be completely unusable if i didn't sew it back together myself with higher quality thread. the velcro straps used to attach to the bike are also way too long- i have a pretty standard road bike frame but when tightened there is barely enough velcro to hold it on."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this is a great bag for our 12-year-old son. he rides his bike to school and he puts his bike lock in there when he rides to and from along with storing his gloves. can hold mini water bottles as well
5.0 out of 5 stars,very functional for a few small items. looks good too. be aware that you won't be able to install a water bottle cage on the down tube. also need to remove bag for the type of bike rack that i have for my car.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"exactly what i needed for my rides. streamlined, not bulky, holds my wallet, phone, keys with room to spare so i don't have to wear a fanny pack when i ride. haven't gotten it wet yet and while it doesn't lock it securely holds your items. my only criticism is that the velcro straps were too long. had to shorten them up to get a tight fit on my frame. otherwise a great little storage bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this bag to attach to the handle of my walker so i can carry my iphone, keys, etc. it fits perfectly and works just as i had hoped!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,product lasted just over 30 days before one of the seam's ripped almost lost my belongings..not recommended!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"got this bag for my son to use when he goes biking. it's perfect for holding his wallet and cellphone. is also large enough to fit a few more things, if needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i love how this product look and functions. i used as soon as i took it out of the package and it holds my cell phone and keys with room to spare. thanks for such a great product.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"warning: when trying to attach this a bike where the brake line runs under the main frame, tightening the bag properly results in sticky brakes. also, it is rigid enough that forget carrying anything else in that area... no water bottle, and your lock has to be contorted to get around it. not practical or functional."
5.0 out of 5 stars,just the right size to store everything i need. the one velcro strap that attaches to the verticle part of the frame is long enough to allow my bike rack to pass between the bag and frame. very happy with my purchase
1.0 out of 5 stars,not a durable bag as i'd thought it was. cheaply made. put any tool in tupperware then put that in the thing.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"pretty much exactly what you would expect. seems plenty sturdy enough and holds enough to make it possible to not wear a backpack for long rides. i can get a mini pump, extra tube, a few tools, wallet, phone and car key into mine without any issue. if you try to go more than that the sides will bulge out so that they brush your legs, but i am glad to have it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,nice bike bag i switch from trek hybrid to a felt road bike and a bag fits perfectly on either bikeenough room for a phone (if you don’t mount your phone on the handlebars) house keys and a few other small items like a protein bar or protein gel
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i intended on this being a little more centered in terms of mounting on the bike to fold out to accompany more storage space. i now see the intended purpose. it’s good at holding my bike gloves and a small bike rope lock, it won’t expand and close with much more. very easy install. overall good protection from weather. 3/5"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"the item zipper is placed on the bottom. which is awkward and uncomfortable to put you cell, water ect."
5.0 out of 5 stars,".we bought two for our mini-pro segways and the fit just right. carries our chargers in the bag and assorted other needs. durable, zippered, and three straps that are velcro. price vs performance: good"
5.0 out of 5 stars,can easily fit a spare tire or tube in the pouch plus multiple other tools. happy with this purchase!
5.0 out of 5 stars,wanted a bike storage that was a roomy enough for me to carry all the essentials. this has plenty of space and a durable feel. it does take up the space for my second water bottle so i might use a different bag for rides where i'll need to carry the extra water. but very happy and would recommend!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"delivery was prompt and product exactly as pictured. plenty of room for phone, wallet, keys,tools. my favorite kind of accessory: installed it doesn't cost you a second thought. durable materials."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice product to store my spare tube, changing tools, and my bike lock. also thin enough to not hot my legs as i pedal nor be in the way of my water bottle mount."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to put on, carries what i need and keeps it all safe and dry. it’s a great case that doesn’t get in the way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i just love this thing; the straps hold everything steady but easy to remove, is does not bother me while pedalling, i currently have inside a minipump, wench, tire patchs, hex keys, spare tire, and i think i can fit some more stuff. the thing? the price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is an excellent accessory back that nicely/cleanly fits under the cross bar of a man's bicycle. i do not know how it will work on a bicycle with a drop bar. the bag is large enough to hold a cell phone, keys, snack(s) and a few tools."
5.0 out of 5 stars,good bag on the touchdown geometry up tube bikes. can't find a place on the radrover but fits on the tuesday model quite nicely . using it for water and cash. works perfectly.
2.0 out of 5 stars,make sure the dimensions work for your bike. it really only fits if you have a perfectly square corner of rails. costs 5.99 to return so not worth doing that... guess i will just keep it or give it away. it’s useless for most bikes
5.0 out of 5 stars,i needed a bag larger than my undersea bag to bring along tools. this is perfect and looks great. very happy with my purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice compact storage accessory. fits well and still allows space for my water bottle holder. very satisfied, this works well for my purposes, keeps cell phone and wallet for easy access. blue matches my bike frame perfectly!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a very nice compact storage bag that has been dk 200 tested.just a couple thing that i would like to see added to the bag. the velcro ties could be double stitched for durability (i had mine double stitched by our local upholstery). additionally, it would be nice to have a limiter on how far the zipper can unzip. while riding on gravel and you want to access your nutrition on the go, you could potentially open the ban to wide and have items fall out.you need to be aware that you lose one bottle rack as the bad occupies that space."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this product is great for what i need while riding for my phone or wallet.most important the shipper reached out to me and replaced this product free of charge when i received my 1st order damaged and followed up on the 2nd order. great customer service
5.0 out of 5 stars,"very good size for samsung note phone, wallet & keys. seems well made. fits snug. recommend & plan to buy another for 2nd bike."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great little pouch. i’d like to see a version with an expandable compartment but for now this serves my purpose
4.0 out of 5 stars,bought this to hold my phone while out on the trails. also can run my headphones without having it in my pocket.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great product for the price point. serves my needs for the bike. i found that after installation/positioning was satisfactory, trimming the attachment straps allowed me to tuck the ends in for a clean, flush finish."
5.0 out of 5 stars,very easy to use install. just big enough to haul a bike pump but not so big that it interferes. for some reason i received two of them i’ll have to look to see if i accidentally hit buy two. i’ll just give one as a gift.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"aside from the velcro getting dirty pretty easily, it works great and fits fine on my bike."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"decent bag.... just fits on my 15"" specialized rockhopper, but i mean just. i have to push it into place while riding. seems like it is probably going to wear out from wearing against the frame."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to install, holds alot. im not crazy about the color of the blue, but it works great."
5.0 out of 5 stars,the storage bag fits well on bike. velcro straps slide around more than i liked so i zip tied the velcro straps down.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i was very happy with this storage bag, but after 9 months, the front top velcro strap ripped loose from the storage bag. the threads used were just not strong enough to with stand the swinging motion of the bag.great response from vendor, they are sending out a replacement"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"well made, easy to attach to bike, large enough for keys, cell phone, wallet, looks good but is out of the way when riding. great little storage bag. it does the job! highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this could be a 5 star but i can’t verify the water resistance or security features. but i like it, it fits well and i’m praying the zipper does malfunction."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"fits my bike well, have been able to ride lately. only thing is the zipper is a little hard to work, might just need to be broken in. its big enough to carry several items needed for emergency repairs like spare tub, and tools. i would reccomend for someone who ride for a great distance and needs additional storage that is out of the way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased 2 of these storage bags from amazon and they were delivered in two days as promised. the bags fit perfectly on my two schwinn's and they look great. straps are easy to use and tighten around the frame, even around cables, with no problem. great product for the price."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"its an alright product. it does what it says it does. fits everything i will need for a ride in case i puncture. i wouldn't recommend it for a thin roadbike (width wise), as it is rubs with your legs if you fill the bag up to the max. this bag would be prefect for a thicker frame."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice quality storage bag that will hold my phone and keys. attaches securely to the bicycle frame. if you are looking for a small, quality storage bag, this one may meet your needs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,impressed that it fits on my son’s 20” bike! it can hold a small bag of snacks and a small water bottle so he’s happy! also works as shown on my husband’s bike. does not fit in the middle on my women’s bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this mostly for my wife to use on our schwinn tandem bike. she loves it! it looks, great, it's built strong, and mounted easily. at first we were concerned that it might not hold a water bottle, but no problem with that. it is the perfect size for our needs."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this bag is awesome! i'm short so it is a bit tight on my hard-tail mountain bike against my water bottle cage but still fits. it has tons of space and i no longer have to wear my backpack on rides because everything i need will fit in here
5.0 out of 5 stars,the bag is perfect for my bike repair supplies and a tube. i also carry my cell in the bag. i like that i can track miles but don’t need to look at my screen while i ride. doesn’t interfere with my biking. i think it will be a great bag for years.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"works very well for most bikes. streamline yet spacious enough for wallet, keys, cellphone and even more easily. good construction."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i bought this bag to carry my bike lock chain. the frame on my trek verve 2 has a little wider tubes than other frames i have had and these straps accommodate the the wider tubes nicely. i like the purchase i made. it does what i wanted to do with it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,really well made bike pack. fits my frame perfectly without obstructing my water bottle. couldn’t be more satisfied!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i've had this for a couple of months, it installed easily on my bike and i was able to store everything i needed to in it including a tire tube, tire levels, multi-tool, and a snack. however, after a couple of months use the zipper broke off (see attached picture)."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"writing this as i just got back from my bike ride, the straps that attach to bike frame are very weak. one of the top straps right about ripped off, second one has signs of strain as well. i've got about 3lbs of carry weight. very disappointed"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"the quality of the bag is great and it was very easy to install onto the bike. the only issue i have is that this bag may not fit with a bottle cage mounted to the down tube.in my case, i have a delta bottle cage, and the two do not fit nicely together. this may be due to the geometry of my frame but i would expect most folks will have this same issue."
5.0 out of 5 stars,it’s not a option for a lock but it’s super roomy and east to put on the bike. i bought these as father’s day gifts for my husband and brother in law. it fits a lot of items in it!
2.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag was nice enough, but the velcro straps were designed in such a way that they were too long to secure to my frame. this was on a 1985 schwinn sprint, so i don’t feel that my frame’s tubes are all that small in diameter. basically the bag was completely useless."
4.0 out of 5 stars,this didn’t fit my bike very well (women’s bike design ) as it would get in the way of my drink holders but it fit my husbands bike good (men’s bike ) . it holds the minimum of what you need to carry
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i needed a bag to carry my heavy sinkers when i go fishing so i wouldn't have to carry them in my tackle box, giving me extra room. this product works great, everyone on the boat that saw this said they are getting one. very durable and strong, wash the saltwater residue off easily."
4.0 out of 5 stars,this bike storage works perfectly for what i needed if for. fits well and adjustable. straps are a bit long so once i got it where i wanted it i just cut the remaining strap that was not needed. the zipper is on the left side which i wish it was on the right but not a deal breaker.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice size bag my 6"" 1/2"" x 3"" 1/4"" cellphone fits nicely in addition to my thick wallet and key ring."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is a little larger than the old triangle bag it replaced. i use it to carry a spare tube, tire levers and a plastic raincoat. has room to spare even with all these things in it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great size and location for when i need to carry a little more than what my seat pack will hold but i don't need to use something as large as a handlebar bag or rack trunk. it's also easy to quickly strap it on and take it off.
5.0 out of 5 stars,i usually just put my keys and iphone 11. pretty easy to install and it doesn’t look bulky.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"bag is a little odd to use, glad to have cause now i know i don’t like it too much."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"velcro type straps too long for wrapping around posts, so strap extends outward from bike. bag doesn’t attach as expected. hard to put anything in to bag due to location."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to get on your bike and it stays in place. the material seems sturdy enough, but i have not used it in the rain so can't speak to water resistance. the only thing i am not too hot on is the position of the zipper. i can see how if you aren't careful, you could potentially loose things out of the pouch while you are trying to access it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,bag is too large for a road bike. it interferes with your drink bottle. fits better on a dirt bike if you use only drink bottle. the bag is great other wise.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i use it to store my phone, keys, wallet etc. works for me, and durable enough."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i really enjoy the ease that this bag offers me. i have a small road bike and it can store things like keys, phone, gloves, etc. the only suggestion/complaint i have is that velcro rubs on my pants causing threading problems. it was a huge deal and i was able to workaround the issue but something to note."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great size, quality materials, love the inner mesh pocket to keep the metal tools separated from my phone. i bought a black one for my bike & the red one for my wife's bike. we love them!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,i like that it's inexpensive and does the job. it's not something that will last forever but it should have a decent life span. the first thing to go will probably be the straps but i've been using it on my mountain bike with a heavy bike lock in it and it's holding up! i did have a problem with the the straps being too small for my frame. i had to add an extension to the strap on the middle of the top bar. i ride a trek 2018 superfly 5.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this storage bag arrived quickly, was the right size for my bike and roomy enough to hold my phone + wallet + wind-breaker. i highly recommend."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i ordered this bag to hold a bike lock, reflective strap i wear, and my riding gloves. it holds all with room to spare. i am happy with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great storage capacity and situated perfectly and interferes with nothing while riding!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"so far a nice bike frame bag. maybe i’m too picky, but i think it’s a little bit big. i just do casual riding, and just needed something big enough for my phone. i’d have preferred it be a bit smaller. it takes up a lot of space in the frame."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"‘tis easy to ‘install’ with convenient velcro straps, and easy to open with nicely sized zipper. the inside pouch is a big help because it keeps special items secure. the color selection is a nice plus."
4.0 out of 5 stars,great item for a commuter or road bike. ddoes not work well for a full suspension bike. doesn’t fit the frame design. can put a full size rain wind breaker in it.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"very nice size, frees up room from under the seat for a light. holds a lot!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this sack is functional. i have to carry extra tissue, chap stick, mecklazine for virtigo, my cell phone and tylenol. this bag houses all these items and more without getting in the way. i'm happy with this purchase."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"did not realize that you have to remove a water bottle cage to make this bag work. i have two cages on my bike, i drink a lot when i ride. the bag will not fit with two cages mounted on the bike. too late to return it. would have been good to know, or maybe i missed that in the description"
5.0 out of 5 stars,this handy bag mounts under your seat below the top tube of your bike with enough room for my legs to avoid hitting it while pedaling. i like to see the road as much as possible so a bag that mounts on the handlebars is not an option. i keep my water bottles behind my seat and my pump on the down-tube.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it’s a bag. it does bad stuff. just check the measurement and angles to see if your frame properly accommodates it (and water bottle placement). haven’t used it enough to determine how well it will wear, but it feels strong and zippers work well."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"plenty of storage for cellphone, keys, and wallet with space remaining. i really like that it doesn't hang off the back of the seat, which would block the reflector or tail light."
5.0 out of 5 stars,happy with purchase. easy to install. carries the right amount of goodies.
3.0 out of 5 stars,this is a nice product to have for your bike. holds the things you need and stores out of the way
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this little bag,fits my vallet keys,just what i was looking for,i can highly recommended"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this bag. it fits nicely on my mountain bike and is very roomy. i can fit two bike tubes, patch kit, and other repair tools with no problem."
4.0 out of 5 stars,this is large enough for bike socket wrench and some other necessary tools for a day of biking. it stays put when fastened and doesn't get in the way while pedaling.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"fits good, easy to open. holds wallet, phone, keys easily. if you want to put more in you could but it might start to get crowded. still a great bag for what i intended to use it for."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"was worried that it might interfere with my water bottle on the down tube but it fits perfect. the space is perfect for iphone 8, wallet,etc. we'll have to see how it holds up as the season goes, so far so good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is perfect. decent size and completely out of the way. the only change i would make would be to put the zipper on the right side, since i'm right handed. but that is a very minor, personal issue ... so it's still 5 stars or more."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"would definitely recommend. just enough room for my wallet, phone, and other small items. just remember to put the straps under the brake/gear lines so you can still use them."
1.0 out of 5 stars,in order for me to mount my bike on my cars bike rack i have to undo one of the velcro straps but just recently one of them broke off. not cool! i was liking this bag since it has a lot of space but for it to fall apart so quick. not cool!
5.0 out of 5 stars,great to carry the small things needed for a ride. would recommend for trail ridding.
1.0 out of 5 stars,large storage but the velcro straps that hold it to the bike frame fell off within two months
4.0 out of 5 stars,"great place to repair kit , pump and phoneeasy to attachstraps could be shorter"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this for my bike and just used it on my first 40 mile bike ride. it was easy to install, seems durable, and had way more space than i was expecting. i was able to fit my wireless headphone case, wallet, keys, external battery charger, light for my bike, and i still had plenty of room to spare. i would highly suggest this for anyone that is looking for something that can hold items similar to the ones listed above."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"attaches easily (no tools), good quality, and holds more than you might think by looking at it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"seems good quality to be lightweight. only thing i don't like is that it's quite a bit bigger than i expected. putting it on my down tube takes away a water bottle spot on my bike. other than that, seems good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is a perfect fit for my bike. it is big enough to hold several items not just keys and phone, but is also fits neatly under the bar so that it's out of the way."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this product fit perfect on my ebike wich has a sloped frame just perfect. strong velcro and good zipper quality. i would purchase agai if this one ever wore out which i doubt it ever will. i use it for my wallet, keys and what ever is in my pockets."
4.0 out of 5 stars,holds cell phone and a water bottle no problem. fits and works great
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the perfect bag on my road bike - large enough for stuff for the ride (plus room for an extra small water bottle, or a folded rain jacket), but too large to bother my legs. love it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"attaches simply to your bike frame with velcro straps and holds tight. roomy enough for a cable lock, wallet, cell phone, car keys and other junque. withstood multiple mountain bike runs from the top of mammoth mountain and surrounding trails. very cost effective bag."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this fits my bike pretty well, the velco clamp straps are good and hold up just fine.1 star taken away because of the stitching. i seem to have to cut a thread off every so often of using it.but it holds my phone and wallet pretty good!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i needed a place to keep my phone, keys etc when i bike. this pouch was easy to put on and the design allows you a variety of options for placement. i also adjusted the straps so i am able to still place my bike on my bike rack without removing the pouch. very well made and lots of space for your valuables. i fit my keys and phone and there is room for more."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this frame bag works for what i need. it is large enough for my foldable lock, wallet, phone, keys and tire tools. the only issue is the hook & loop straps are just barely long enough for the top tube on my cannondale quick 4."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag is quite big, and that's great. however on my mtb it takes up most of the space in the frame triangle, leaving not enough space for the water bottle cage. i cannot say how robust it is, since i only went for a couple of rides."
3.0 out of 5 stars,not very durable. the stitching on the straps that secure to bike are coming apart. would not recommend this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is so useful i can go riding with out a bag. it holds wallet, cell, anything else small."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great product, very versatile, exactly what i was looking for!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,the top straps are not long enough to attach to my kent oakwood hybrid. i need to find extension straps. so much for fits all bikes otherwise seems well made.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it was a little larger than i expected, it fits on the frame of my schwinn mountain bike. it easily holds a spare tube, wrenches tire levers etc, with room to spare."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"very well made, attaches securely, large capacity. very happy with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i can easily fit a couple of tubes, my mini pump and all my tools in this bag and still have room left over for snacks! snacks!!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"purchased & received this storage bag after trying others and found this one much better. it doesn't move around, has plenty of room to put things in and doesn't hit your legs while riding. would recommend purchasing again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this storage bag has plenty of room for your wallet, phone, keys and more. i would strongly recommend this bag to bike enthusiasts."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it fitted really good in my walmart bike and fits even better on my specialized mountain bike. no hard shake, fits an extra bottle water, phone, sunglasses and my cereal bar for the ride."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this bag is almost perfect! the zipper location in relation to frame could be better. it looks great and is functional on my cannondale quick six.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i really like this storage bag. it holds more than i thought it might (travel pump, iphone, wallet, keys) and i even fit a scarf and windbreaker in it also. i've ridden in a light rain and it was totally water resistant. it's slim, so completely out of the way, yet accessible. i love the colors--mine is purple."
5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect fit for location without any hinderance to riding
5.0 out of 5 stars,"arrived quick and fits great on my mtb bike. haven't used in weather, so not sure how water resistant it is. does hold phone, replacement tube and keys with ease. we will see how it holds up on the trails this summer."
4.0 out of 5 stars,case fits well under main cross tube. zipper opens along top so contents do not fall out. my legs do not come close to hitting it when pedaling.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"o didn't check to see that this bag would fit the bar configuration on my bike. it didn't. but i was able to position it differently and still make it work. i really like it because it holds quite a bit even though it's very low profile and doesn't get in the way. it's very easy to put on and take off also. over all, a very good purchase!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,the pouch is big enough to store small items like your keys wallet phone etc. but small enough that it doesn't hit your knees while pedaling.
5.0 out of 5 stars,fits everything i need however it is too close to the water bottle holder
1.0 out of 5 stars,"cheap stitching means you can’t carry much in here without it ripping where the velcro straps attach to the bag. only carrying a bike lock, phone charger and multi tool. not recommended."
5.0 out of 5 stars,when you need it you'll be happy that you have it and if you don't buy it and not have a safety it you know you know for emergency and you're going to be walking home
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i used it to carry all emergency bike kit, loving it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,love this for my bike no longer have to carry a back
5.0 out of 5 stars,high quality easy install zipper easy to use colors match my bike the velcro straps are very good have to move the bag when i put on carrier easy to do lots of room keep small bottle of water and tools to repair tires the last time i road got two flat tires and i was 12 miles away from home so its is good to have the tools on hand.
5.0 out of 5 stars,very easy to attach or move. i prefer to put the flat side on the point facing the seat so it is easier to see the phone. i like the fact that the phone container has velcro (r) so it can be easily removed when i go into a store or lock up the bike.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"it is what i wanted, but small. i can carry a small tire pump inner tube and tools ro change a flat. the security is to remove it and take it with you."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"arrived quickly, as described. i bought two for different bikes, they are adjustable and fit on to very different frames with no trouble."
5.0 out of 5 stars,very good product. i like the color matches my girlfriends blank. has a decent amount of storage quality seems to be adequate with description. this is a very good deal for the money that you will spend for the product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,it’s awesome i use it all the time on my to and from practice or going for a ride to hold my stuff so it doesn’t fall out of my pockets. it’s great i think.
5.0 out of 5 stars,i love this product is the perfect size for my bike and leaves room for my water bottle. i am absolutely in love and extremely happy with my purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"love this. inside is a pocket that fits my iphone 7 plus perfectly, keeping it separated from my keys and other stuff i normally stuff into this while riding. it fit my standard department store huffy just fine. stays out of the way while riding. it's bigger than i expected, holds plenty. highly recommended."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i wouldn't ride anywhere without my aduro bike bag now that i have one. it stays tight to the bicycle frame, holds a surprising amount of stuff and is easy to access. it never gets in the way yet is easily detached if you move it to another bicycle. a better idea is to have one on every bike. great product."
4.0 out of 5 stars,fits ok. velcro straps are not made for smaller tube framed bikes. barely catches on the velcro to lock in place.
5.0 out of 5 stars,does not fit on a girls bike.had to return.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"connected to bike frame quickly and easily, has way more room than i expected for keys, headphone, bike tools, towel, etc. very light weight and streamlined. love this bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,it’s a well made frame bag. good storage capacity easy to install
5.0 out of 5 stars,my chain / tools / locks / air pump / even a 16 oz. water fit this bag with some room left over . works perfect for me
5.0 out of 5 stars,"before the bag, i had no where to put my belongings while biking. now, i carry all of my essentials including cell phone and keys. mud and water resistant too."
3.0 out of 5 stars,it hangs oddly on my woman's bike and sometimes gets in the way of my legs. i use it anyway to keep my mini pump wrenches and id in when i ride.
5.0 out of 5 stars,very easy to install. large enough that i removed the small bag that i had under the seat. zipper opening is wide enough to make putting items in and taking items out easy.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"really like this product! super simple to attach to your bike, very stable during your ride, and it’s wide enough to fit a water bottle-phone-keys. exactly what i was looking for."
5.0 out of 5 stars,just as pictured. nice fit and doesn’t move while riding.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"a nice simple bag that is not in the way because it is not very wide (about 2""). it will carry your wallet, cellphone and a bike tool kit, maybe squeeze in a sandwich. so limited space, but that's why it is out of the way!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"had just picked up a new bike and wanted a little storage pouch to carry phone, wallet, keys etc. took it for a test ride, was able to put all i wanted and the wifes phone and wallet in it to, plus extra space. it doesn't interfere with the ride at all. you would have no idea it was even there. three velcro straps keep it very secure, i was not at all concerned with losing it. cannot verify the water resistance with it as i haven't been out in the rain yet."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i like it because it goes with my red bike! it did repel water like i had hoped, everything was still dry inside!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i would definitely say that this frame bag does the job and does it well! i was able to fit my bike pump in it along with tools, wallet, keys and probably could squeeze in a bike lock, but i have not done that yet. it is also out of the way and does not interfere with riding. if you are looking for a bag to store your things while riding, consider this one as it holds nicely to the frame."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this bag is the perfect size and weight to carry everything a biker needs. it seems sturdy enough to handle any kind of weather.
5.0 out of 5 stars,very well made. attaches easily and securely. more room that a typical under seat bag and yet very unobtrusive. very satisfied with the product.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"great pouch for bicycle, durable and designed with the rider in mind."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i wish amazon would let us give half stars as a score. the item does not blow my socks off, so i don't think that it deserves 5 stars, but it is everything that it said it would be online. we've yet to really test it on a long trip and i can/will update when we do."
5.0 out of 5 stars,well made and roomy. easy to put on the bike
4.0 out of 5 stars,"large storage but looks funny when i mounted it on my road bike. it would be good for regular bike but definitely not for road... other than that, it’s a good bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice bag, good zipper and it's nice to have a place to put my wallet and whatever else i would otherwise carry in my pockets"
5.0 out of 5 stars,i bought this for my husband & he really likes it. he likes that it’s in front on the frame rather than behind the seat. it appears to be well made. he hasn’t used it yet but plans to soon.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag is as expected, but one of the plastin strap clamps broke right away.i have let amazon know and am waiting to see what they do about it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,it fits beautifully on my bike. i am female but i ride a male bike with the cross bar. i ordered this because i had a dangled fall on my bike trying to get on and started with a bag on the handle bars. this is a good solution for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"can fit a repair kit, small wallet, and a water bottle. hangs securely. does not get in way when cycling. appears to be of good materials, well sewn, and should last a while - been using it for over a month now."
5.0 out of 5 stars,fits oddly shaped bike frames like my trek. easy to install and get to.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is of good quality and serves its purpose well. when cycling i like to bring a few extra things on the road with me because when you're 30 miles from home you may need them. this bag fits my pump, bike tool and misc. snacks when i'm doing one of my 50 mile treks."
4.0 out of 5 stars,fits a little wierd and when on bike reaching the zipper and getting things in and out is wierd if not difficult but it does hold your stuff

5.0 out of 5 stars,another place to put your gear when lol ng distance biking
1.0 out of 5 stars,"within the first 2 months, one of the velcro straps tore off due to poor material quality. within six months, a huge hole had worn into the bottom due to poor material quality. the fabric is disintegrating.whoever designed & manufactured this understood the concept of a frame bag, but they clearly lack the expertise to make a quality product. based on my experience as a manufacturing process engineer, i wouldn't recommend buying anything from a company that offers such junk."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i like the bag. it is big enough for me to put the air pump, an extra tube, and wrenches, and the zipper feels good. i don't see any downsides to the bag and it was very well priced."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"perfect extra storage on bike, i use it to hold tools, keys and wallet on long rides"

1.0 out of 5 stars,after second ride the stitching on top front strap broke. luckily i had tape to secure it to my frame. definitely they need to make velcro straps stronger. other then that i really liked it until it broke.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"fits my bike good and holds my wallet, phone, keys, and sunglasses without any problem and has room left over if needed. liked this one so much i ordered another for my daughter to use on her bike."
4.0 out of 5 stars,it's a great bag but unusable for bike packing or distance riding. to use it you must remove a water bottle cage. this defeats the purpose e having extra storage

5.0 out of 5 stars,great product. unfortunately it was too large to fit on my wife's bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,nice bag but didn't fit on my bike so gay to a freind
2.0 out of 5 stars,the shape and storage was great but only on my second ride the straps started too tear.
5.0 out of 5 stars,fits securely right near the water bottle and doesn’t get in the way while riding. i didn’t rate the water resistance because i don’t ride in inclement weather and i rated the security 3/5 because it’s not meant to leave valuables in while your bike is unattended in public.
5.0 out of 5 stars,this product deserves a good review. i really wanted something to carry my phone and keys and wound up getting more room than i thought.
5.0 out of 5 stars,love this thing. fits everything and is completely out of the way
5.0 out of 5 stars,easy to attach on bike. good storage for essentials.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"great quality bag, fits perfect on bicycle frame, lots of space for spare tubes and tools."

5.0 out of 5 stars,nice quality & universal fit on any bike
3.0 out of 5 stars,it didn't fit like i hopped. if you put bike tools they clang and bang around. it gets in the way of the water bottle cage. you can only use one water bottle cage on your bike with this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"the storage pouch fits a phone, sunglasses, keys and more. highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"fits perfect. large enough to small tool kit, phone, snacks, and a personal security item..."
1.0 out of 5 stars,poorly made product. the material is very cheap. and the plastic strap holder broke off immediately when trying to strap it to my bike... don't buy this crap.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"bag is cheap and straps are too long. it was just good enough not to return, but not by much."
5.0 out of 5 stars,this product just what i needed it to do and what it promised it would! i also love the netting on the inside to keep my small/more fragile things separate from getting lost amongst the larger ones.
3.0 out of 5 stars,i have a note 8 and it fits easily. the problem i have is the bag zips where it attaches to the frame and can be difficult to open. the velcro may rip and could use reenforcing.
5.0 out of 5 stars,fits nicely and provides adequate space for storing items. nice quality and should last for years
5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect size for what i need to carry.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"larger than what it looks like in the photo. will honestly not be using this. but it doesn’t it’s purpose, 4 stars"
5.0 out of 5 stars,i own one of these before this seems a little better made! and not so long.
4.0 out of 5 stars,this bike bag came as specified and fit my bike well. i like the size and it's room. holds more then my under seat bag. i don't notice it's even there while riding. seem to be made well it has been durable and functional for me and a good value.

5.0 out of 5 stars,worked out really well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this fit my bike nice, lots of room for my phone and keys. easy to install, took 5 minutes if that, easy to take off the bike and carry with you if needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"love having this, i use it to put my cellphone and keys in when i ride. works great with my mountain bike and it doesn't interfere with anything for me."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"the installation is difficult because the velcro was too long, and did not hold properly. also, the inside storage is not awkward (doe not keep things organized) and doesn't hold a lot of things. finally, because of the two above things, the velcro eventually tore off the bag, and i can no longer use it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a great item. it can hold my 6"" phone as well as my keys, portable bicycle pump, and assorted cords with room to spare. it mounts really easy: just velcro three straps onto the frame of your bicycle and you're all set. located at the top forward-most end, zipper placement is great. overall, this is a great little accessory for your bicycle at an affordable price!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,not sure why asks if easy to drink from it's not a bottle. fits bike will. easy to secure

5.0 out of 5 stars,as described
5.0 out of 5 stars,"good value; able to place two bottles in standard positions on frame by installing upside down (but must be careful when opening; contents easily fall out, as this places the opening on the bottom of the container)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"use it all the time! durable, dependable and looks great too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,this is genius. simply attach to the bike and you have a great carrier for your cell phone and keys. perfect product.

5.0 out of 5 stars,big enough for my portable tire pump.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i've been using this bag for almost 2 weeks now, and so far i have not been dissapointed. first of all the price is excellent and inexpensive so you're getting a great trade for your money. the bag itself comes in 2 sizes, i got the smaller one because as you can see in the pictures, i also have a water bottle attached to the frame. for reference i have a 29"" wheel with a 21""frame trek marlin 6.although it is the smaller bag, it still has alot of room in it for my 2 wallets, portable puncture repair kit, mini tool kit, battery bank, that still leaves some room. plus thanks to its 3 point strap attachment, rest assured that it will not be coming loose or wobbling even on dirt trails."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"works very well. stores a lot, but doesn't interfere with your legs."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"came with no straps to hold my bike...i checked in side,out side... this is joke!!! ???"

5.0 out of 5 stars,maybe hard to arrange things due to triangular form
5.0 out of 5 stars,is is a bit larger than i was expecting and will have a better sense once i ride more. i am hoping it doesn't get in the way of my leg while pedaling.
2.0 out of 5 stars,zipper is on bottom of bag..if you open it your stuff just falls out. returned.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"product has a mesh pouch that runs the length of the inside that's great to hold your gear. i keep a spare tire tube, small co2 inflator and have room for two wallets and two phones. the zipper doesn't come loose while riding.i haven't had any exposure to rain/water while riding with it yet, but with the material i don't see much of an issue."
4.0 out of 5 stars,this is what i expected and i'm happy it is working well.
5.0 out of 5 stars,good size. holds a lot of stuff. it does not get in the way while riding.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"excellent product, ideal for carrying stuff on a day long cycling. strong so and durable fabric"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"convenient way to store my phone, snacks, and spare inner tube. buy it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"the material is not so durable. reffering to the stitches. some parts have some overruns. and when you zip it, it's not so easily zip in to close."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"loads of storage space. i go on lengthy bike rides with the family. i normally pack my personal phone, work phone, sub compact glock, wallet, credentials, badge, and jeep keys. zips up tight but it all fits and doesn’t seem to budge while riding. would definitely recommend."
1.0 out of 5 stars,this bag has loose strings all over it. terrible craftsmanship.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"fits nicely on my road bike. roomy, fits my rain gear. i run a cable to my cell phone with the battery charger in the bag. the only issue is that it takes up space where my water bottle sits."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"so far i like it. i haven't given it the official road test as of yet, but i have not doubt it will be fine. a little difficult to attach to my bike frame, but that had more to do with the construction of the frame than the product."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i bought this on an impulse and wasn't sure if it would suit my needs - but it has become something i can't ride without! i keep my keys, money, etc. in it. easy on/off for every trip and for stops along the way. love it. it's much bigger than i expected which was a bonus!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,it works great for me. quite spacious too
5.0 out of 5 stars,this bag can store a lot and if you want to keep the threads strong all you have to do is put a light layer or super glue to prevent any fraying.
5.0 out of 5 stars,for what it is.. it’s a great product for storage and staying out of the way.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"we are really happy with this speedometer/odometer. it was easy to install- the instructions were clear but didn't really need them. the display is a nice size and it's easy to toggle between the different modes. all we're really interested in is the current speed, time, and odometer- and those are readily displayed. a little sensitive on getting the gap between the magnet and the receiver but once i got it set it works fine."
2.0 out of 5 stars,i carry 2 water bottles but this bag won’t allow it any longer because it takes up the space.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"my son loves this! it keeps his phone from falling while he rides wheelies and does combos - he is very happy with it. don’t know about the water resistance (yet), but it looks like it will be good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,tucks nicely under frame out of way amd attaches sturdily great for phones money etc
5.0 out of 5 stars,i have no issues with the bag. i fill it with tools for the ride and it holds a handful of wrenches and other tools no problem at all. it was a little large for my son's bike so in his case the one i ordered for him was installed on the handlebars and that worked out really well.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"i found the size just right. however i have a folding mtn bike and the top tube has a larger diameter then the straps will fit. i made an adjustment by attaching a longer strap and securing it in two places near the outer edges, instead of the one attachment in the center. then i took the velcro strap it came with and sewed it to the new strap. now it is very secure on the frame and opens easier"

5.0 out of 5 stars,works perfect for what i needed
2.0 out of 5 stars,i bought this bike bag for my son to use on his mountain bike. it worked fine for riding around on neighborhood streets but the velcro strap broke loose the first time he took it on a trail. the bag is now useless.

5.0 out of 5 stars,"got this for my brother, he really likes it :) perfect birthday gift for him cuz he loves bikes"
2.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased this in may and was not super impressed with the quality--it's quite cheaply made. the velcro is not sewn onto the bag very well, but i didn't have issues with it. a few days ago this august, the zipper came off the tracks. when i tried to repair it, the zipper itself broke. unlikely to buy again."
5.0 out of 5 stars,the container worked well. except when i need a second water bottle. holds lots of stuff though.
5.0 out of 5 stars,great product
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is very easy to install and has good quality. a fair amount of room to store a phone, wallet, and keys. only thing i would caution is it rides pretty close to the water bottle cage on the current bike. i don't know how it would fit another bike, but for the price, you can not beat this bag."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i like this storage bag. happy with my purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,easy to use & install. easy & secure access when riding.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"seems to be good quality ,but way to big to fit any of my bikes. mountain or hybrid. my fault i measured wrong."
4.0 out of 5 stars,i really like the triangle bag and the only complaint is the velcro straps cannot be tucked away from the zipper. it seems like you have unvelcro the bag to open the zipper which makes it a pain when opening the bag.
5.0 out of 5 stars,this is a very versatile and easy to use mini storage compartment. great idea for cycling and commuting.
1.0 out of 5 stars,use a plastic shopping bag before this garbage. broke after about 20 rides. total junk

5.0 out of 5 stars,just what i needed for house keys wallet and cell phone looks great works great and didnt break the bank.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"compact yet roomy enough for essentials. zipper runs along the top, making sure your stuff stays secure. it has an inside pouch to keep your phone separated from your keys. build quality exceeded my expectations."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"roomy, inexpensive way to carry wallet, phone, etc. good stitching and velcro."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"nice carry all. spacey, colorful, priced right, easy to install...love it. great product.easy to attach. not in the way when pedaling"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i decided to keep the bag because it was the perfect size for my needs and bike frame. however, there were a couple of issues that i had to resolve. first, the material just below the zipper on the inside of the bag has a fraying problem. as a result, the zipper gets stuck a lot in the fraying material. to address this, i cut back the frays with scissors, and applied clear caulk to get them to stay down and out of the way of the zipper, and to prevent further fraying. second, the hook/loop fasteners are slick on the back, so they don't grip my bike frame very well even when tightened down. as a result, they rotate around the frame, causing the bag to constantly shift out of position. my old bag (different manufacturer) did not have this issue. to address this, i put a thin layer of clear caulk underneath the fasteners to make the surface tackier. bottom line, you shouldn't have to ""work on"" a brand new product in order to cure it's flaws."
5.0 out of 5 stars,it does exactly as should. large space inside it.

5.0 out of 5 stars,good little bag for emergency essentials. good value for the price. i wouldn’t keep anything too valuable in it though.

4.0 out of 5 stars,"seems to be well made, especially for the price. i wish it had a pocket on the outside."
4.0 out of 5 stars,it is secure on the bike and has plenty of storage. i don’t think it is water proof but i also haven’t gone through the rain yet. overall i would buy it again.
3.0 out of 5 stars,mounting the storage bag isn't as clean as i'd like it because of the pump i have mounted on the seat tube. i strap it around the pump but ....
3.0 out of 5 stars,a good bag for light trail/road riding. bad bag for mountain biking. i ride hard and do jumps and the seams on this thing broke pretty quickly. would not recommend for mountain biking.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this. it is big enough to carry an air pump, tube change, phone, tissues, and a snack."

5.0 out of 5 stars,it is great. the only issue that i have is that i can't fit my second water bottle in well because this gets in the way.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"the storage saddle allows the rider free of worry, because what is needed fits perfectly inside of your saddle for small repairs you have your air pump with patches extra handy flash light, and for urgencies more then enough room to secure you cell from bumpy rides, and it give your bike that finish look of yes i'm a cyclist"

5.0 out of 5 stars,"the aduro triangle storage bag meets my needs perfectly…it fits securely on the bike frame, offers easy access to contents, large enough to store all my loose stuff like keys, phone and wallet but not so large that it gets in the way, and the price was right."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it doesn't fit perfectly if you don't have a bike with the top tube that looks like the one in the picture, but don't worry. i have a step thru bike so i needed to finagle the bag to attach using only two of the straps. nonetheless, the straps hold very well and i haven't had any issues. the bag holds a lot and is so convenient."

5.0 out of 5 stars,"got this as a gift for my father, he loves how useful and simple it looks. happy with the purchase"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i do a lot of mountain bike riding in the sierra's and have had a few too many encounters with bears, mountain lions, rabid skunks, and shady humans requiring me to carry protection. i needed a safe and secure way to carry my 9mm in a location i can get to quickly if i ever need it. there are very few triangle frame bags that have structural side support to maintain shape, most of them allow the weapon to thrash around in the bag and provide little to no protection, which simply isn't safe. this bag is perfect, providing enough structure to keep the barrel facing down while protecting the weapon from a side impact. the material and stitching are high quality and the straps are plenty strong to hold it in place with a few pounds of weight and a gnarly trail. i highly recommend this bag if you have a hardtail and need to carry protection."

4.0 out of 5 stars,price
4.0 out of 5 stars,fits as it says.
5.0 out of 5 stars,i put a pump two tubes and tools in it.love it!
5.0 out of 5 stars,as described
5.0 out of 5 stars,easy to set up
2.0 out of 5 stars,"could have been better, but the price is, you get what you paid for. although, materials are poor, sewing is not great, and fitting kind of lacks. so, if you want something that looks great! better pay more. if you want something that solves an issue for the lowest price, this will do it"
5.0 out of 5 stars,great product
5.0 out of 5 stars,quality product
5.0 out of 5 stars,"perfect fit, durable material used."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great product!
5.0 out of 5 stars,thank you
5.0 out of 5 stars,"good size, fits my mini tire pump, spare tube, multitool, etc. easily. the velcro attachments scrape my legs once in a while which is a little annoying.update - have had this thing attached to my bike now for several months at least. basically have forgotten it's there. seems durable and velcro no longer scraping me (corners softened up over time). added back the stars i removed for that issue!"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"bag is well made and is a nice size, however, this will not work on a 24in bike...so dont buy it if you have anything under a 26in...i have had to just strap it to the handle bar and leave it flapping in the breeze because there is not enough room on the frame on a 24 in bike for this bag..."
4.0 out of 5 stars,good product.
1.0 out of 5 stars,stitching for the velcro is very bad quality. all the loops are coming apart straight out of the package. i don't expect it to last long. should have returned it but already had it attached and used it on the trails.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"ill designed with the zipper on top, under bike's frame. upper straps too short for my bike (cannondale).to prevent this kind of problems, manufacturer must position opening of storage bag triangle on its side....velcro straps must also be longer to accommodate wider bike frames...."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"so i finally get my bike ready and fit this thing on and find out the straps are not long enough! now i have to modify it to work.it's designed to fit the ""old school"" type round frames and won't fit anything larger. too bad, i could have easily given this 5 stars."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"works and holds ok but because it is mounted on the frame in front of and under the bike seat it hits water bottle and such it lays to the side of the water bottle. also makes it difficult to put bike on a rear car bike rack that suspends the bike because this is normally the point of attachment. my bike is 27 1/2"". anything smaller would be worse."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"fast shipment, good product!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,returned for refund. straps aren't long enough to wrap around the bars on a mountain bike.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"this is a well made bag that appears to be durable. the straps are very short, and i had to add black cable ties to keep them in place. but otherwise excellent."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"this product looks good and the pocket can store plenty. the only problem is is much larger than expected, so it won't fit inside the frame of my bike, with my water holder.after dealing with customer service, they were very apologetic. they also issued a full refund. the product itself is a good product, just too big for its intended space on my bike.see pic and how i had to adjust."
3.0 out of 5 stars,very plastic feeling but will hold sufficient items like car keys and wallet for the bike. too early to tell if it holds up but if it does i will get a second one. let's see.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"not very durable. the fabric is incredibly thin, fragile and will wear very quickly where it rubs the seat tube. there is already a hole worn into mine and i've only ridden about 300 miles with it."
1.0 out of 5 stars,the zipper broke before i could use it! had to process a return which is annoying for a ~$10 item.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag broke on my first ride. the sewing on one of the straps fell apart. poor quality craftsmanship. bag design isn't great either. it doesn't have sealable compartments inside, meaning the contents just get all jumbled up when you ride."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"looks good fits good. kids put some tools in it and the straps came off the bag, had to sew it pack on with some braided fishing string."
2.0 out of 5 stars,zipper broke and bag ripped within a couple of weeks of owning. went on less than handful of rides. i was really exictied and was very useful but if you do any type of vigorous riding then i wouldn’t recommend this product .
1.0 out of 5 stars,did not fit
2.0 out of 5 stars,straps weren’t long enough to fit around tubingi have a fitre mountain bike framed brand and straps way to short
2.0 out of 5 stars,ok. not worth $10. maybe worth 4 or 5 bucks at best.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"mounted on my bike a week ago, took two trips on paved trails 50 miles altogether. all that was kept in the bag was my wallet and my phone an s8. the bag itself looks nice but the stitching is of poor quality. bag is coming apart from the top stitch by the zipper and the back part where the velcro ties around yor bike is missing half it where the stitch was at to connect the velcro."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"it looks a nice product. durable ,rugged , good material. made well, it just doesn't fit my bike."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i ordered a couple of these so that my wife and i could stop using fanny packs while we were out riding. first, let me say that they are constructed out of some pretty durable, nylon and that the velcro straps are quite sturdy. we've had no problems with them staying in place during our average 15-20 mile rides. i am fairly confident that they'll outlive our bikes. now for the not so good. for starters, they get in the way. how, you ask? well, they get in the way when we try to hang the bikes on either our car-mounted bike rack or our garage rack. basically, this means that we have to remove the packs all the time. not that it takes that long, it's just a little pita that we weren't expecting. i guess i should have noticed this from the product images before i ordered them, but you know. another minor gripe, you can't really get into them very easily while you're riding. if you need to access anything in these pouches you're probably well-advised to stop your bike first or you'll be introducing your face to the ground. there you have it. aside from some incompatibilities with bike racks and ease of use while riding, i suppose you could do worse."
1.0 out of 5 stars,doesn’t fit beach cruisers that have two side by side bars below the main frame bar that is between the handle bars and seat.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"used it on 2 bike rides to carry my wallet and keys only, and its falling apart.crap!"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"good value, but the straps could be a bit longer to accommodate bikes with fatter tubing."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"looking good, but material is really cheap and doesn't fit mountain bike well."
2.0 out of 5 stars,this thing is huge..wouldnt even come close to fitting my mountain bike
2.0 out of 5 stars,"straps too short for my 1.75"" diam. top tube. i guess this is designed for the thinner tubes of a road bike. returned and will look for something else."
3.0 out of 5 stars,was nice until the zipper broke about 2 months in
4.0 out of 5 stars,cool bag. serves it's purpose. quality materials and fits nicely on my bike.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"it says it fits all bikes, nope. not road bikes with two bottle cages. going back."
5.0 out of 5 stars,it was made cheaply with poor zipper and velcro points. do not rely on positive reviews here.
1.0 out of 5 stars,the zipper broke the second time i used it.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"had a spare chain, battery and a allen key in it and the front strap ripped off, first time out with it on, about 10 miles in"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag has enough space for carrying some of my belongings. however, one of the top tube velcro strap broke after one day of commuting (17 miles total) when i barely put any load in it (a phone, 2 co2 cartridges, and a co2 pump)."
3.0 out of 5 stars,wrong color!
4.0 out of 5 stars,it's ok
5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect fit
5.0 out of 5 stars,very useful.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"cheap junk. ended up zip tying it to the bike after one of the straps broke on the first ride (mountain biking). might be fine for someone who just wants to cruise down the road once a week, but this is not made to withstand technical trails."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"after about a week or so with the bag, the zipper started breaking off from the bag itself."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"the bag surely holds a lot patching, tools, phone etc. however it’s a bit bulky and blocks access to one of my bottle holders"
1.0 out of 5 stars,"worked well at the beginning, although with a lot of movement (the bag is not really tightly held to the bike).the stitching for velcro loop broke after 2 months of use."
2.0 out of 5 stars,yes it is a good product but is not for use on girls' bikes that have no horizontal bar at the seat level.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"giving 3* because the lining was ripped. decided to keep because it holds 2phones, husband's wallet, keys and fits bike nicely."
2.0 out of 5 stars,"poorly made, zipper worked hard all the time, zipper slider came off end after about 10 uses. so it's now useless."
4.0 out of 5 stars,the zipper already broke.....
4.0 out of 5 stars,decent quality for the cost. fit my gt rts2 just fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars,thanks
3.0 out of 5 stars,"quality seems alright. plenty of space for my needs. my main issue is with the strap placement. no matter how tight i get it or how i pack it, it sits a little askew (minor, but still annoying). perhaps a 2nd strap on the seatpost tube could fix that. overall, decent product, just needs a little tweaking."
2.0 out of 5 stars,the color is totally off.
2.0 out of 5 stars,"it's quite a bit bigger than it looks in the picture, and gets in the way."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"seems pretty good so far - i haven't had a chance to take it out on the road yet, so i'm not sure how well it will stay on/stay still. i'll update review when i find out."
2.0 out of 5 stars,not match for both tail bike
2.0 out of 5 stars,material de calidad inferior
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this bag, i mtb about 100 miles a week. i no longer l i keep carrying my water backpack because it makes me sweat and is just extra weight on me. this is perfect for my keys, cellphones and wallet. it fits perfectly om my giants fathom 1 29er. although when packed extremely full with my wallet it sticks out and thats because of my water bottle rack. but man i love this thing my phone is secured held nice and tightly along with my keys. sometimes i'll put my wallet but now i just leave it in my car to not overpack it. i have the samsjng galaxy fold which is a bulky phone and i have a lot of keys and let me tell you it fits perfectly and i know i won't have to worry of anything falling. i would buy again maybe black next time although i love my red bag."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased this bag in october. didn't ride much during the winter months. used about 3 months in total. recently the bag has developed a large rip at the bottom of the bag. also the interior separator has ripped. i don't carry a lot of items in the bag. basic bike tools, etc. it appears to have just worn through the material. i would not recommend this. maybe i received a dud. i would like them to replace this item."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i note that none of the pictures on the product page show this bag on a bike with external brake cables or water bottles, which i find convenient omissions since the vast majority of bikes still have rim brakes and external cables...and water bottle cages. nonetheless, it should still work- i just leave the front velcro strap looser so it doesn't rub against the cable (the rear strap goes around the cable housing, so not a problem there). on my popular model hybrid, the bag does rub up against my water bottle- it's a tight fit, but again, workable. i think for the $7 i paid for it, it's pretty good."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"they have great customer service! when i received the bag, the buckle broke within a couple days and i emailed them telling them what had happened. they quickly replaced my order with a new one and the new one is working great! i think i just had a factory defective one the first go around.i love this style of bag because the weight is center mounted and easily accessible. i holds my tools, patches, and my wallet and still has a little bit of extra room. i recommend if you like the center frame mounted style bags! can't beat the price!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this has freed up so much space for me and allowed me to carry other things. i used to have to take my licence it of my wallet, and cram it in my arm band-phone holder with my car key. now i use this for all of the above, plus a canister of bear mace in case i run into unfriendly wildlife.since it has 3 velcro straps it has never come off, and it's design keeps it totally it out of the way. all of that usefulness at this price is unbeatable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"holds a small pump, spare tube, adjustable wrench, allens, tire levers, and still has room for more. definitely holds up to the weather well enough, although i can't personally vouch for wintery stuff. only concern is some extra friction (not huge) on the rear brake cable, which is inherent in the design type - if this bothered me more, i would get a bag to go under the saddle instead, likely from the same maker. as some others have mentioned, it hangs a bit off-center, but this makes getting in it easier."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i ride my bike to work everyday, only 4 miles each way, but one of the most annoying aspects for me is trying to find my keys in my backpack. i loved this because it is easy, simple, and effective. i can drop my phone into it when i start my ride and leave my keys in there as well. looks great on my black bike as well!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,pouches similar in design get close to $100 at recreation stores so i'm glad i found this. it's a great alternative to pouches that strap onto the handlebars and bounce around.
1.0 out of 5 stars,"doesn't work for women's bike even though it says it works on all bikes. straps are crappy, as well, too long. even if it worked on my bike i think the velcro would disturb the brake line. how does this have good reviews???"
5.0 out of 5 stars,works great and really handy for keys and phone etc. its really nice size. it fits my giant roam (medium frame). i like the extra mesh pocket inside. fits in frame nicely so the bag is out of the way
1.0 out of 5 stars,"one of the velcro straps ripped the first time i tried to use it. also, it does not appear to be water resistant considering the zipper runs along the top of the bag and is not protected by a rain flap. returned."
3.0 out of 5 stars,it gets in the way when attaching bike to rack and it is not very water resistant at all. contents got wet in light rain.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it can hold lots of things, it is not too bulky though. it doesn't get in the way when biking and with the zipper on the top you can easily reach down and grab something without having to stop your ride. it is easy to attach and detach with the 3 velcro straps."
5.0 out of 5 stars,great product fits perfectly on any full sized men's bikes. will fit most womens bikes as well (bought for men's). well worth the money if you need to carry anything.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag holds my wallet, phone, and combination cable lock with room to spare. i will be purchasing another for my wife's bike. highly recommended, 5 stars!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"best bag ever. has plenty of room to fit enough for a long ride (phone battery pack, food, headphones, hand warmers, small towel, sanitizer, lipgloss...). the only problem with it is that you can’t fit a second water bottle underneath it."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"purchased this as a gift, dad loves it!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,a rip in the item right out of the box. there goes the water resistance.update: the seller sent another item to replace the defective one upon learning that i had received a defective item. the item is a great fit for my bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i purchased one of these for my dad since he rides his bike nearly everyday. the bag is large enough to carry necessary repair tools and a bike tube, but fits easily on the bike out of the way. this bag has worked so well for his needs that he purchased a second one for his electric bike."
5.0 out of 5 stars,handy tool and lock holder for a great price.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i wish it were a tad bigger, but it does what it is supposed to. fits nicely on bike and does not interfere with me at all."
5.0 out of 5 stars,perfect fit. thanks to the selling for the follow up email. everything looks good. i may get another one for my other bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,this is perfect for my brother's bike. it seems to be of good quality and arrived quickly.
5.0 out of 5 stars,large storage capacity! in fact i was most surprised by it's dimensions so probably not practical for racing but it's convenient and easy to access on (long) rides.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this storage bag came in handy for my husband. he uses it on his folding bike since he has to take the train to dc and then bike to work. he stores all of his essential bike tools (just in case), which he's actually had to use since purchasing the bag this week. it fits perfectly and is durable. he's used it in the rain and sun."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i was very happy with the overall quality and size of this cycling pouch. it is big enough to fit a phone, keys, and my sunglasses case which is all that i really need to carry with me."
5.0 out of 5 stars,very satisfied with product. seems very durable and holds decent space.
3.0 out of 5 stars,"smaller than expected, so difficulty figuring on how to connect it to bike"
4.0 out of 5 stars,i broke the part that the velcro is supposed to go through but it can be easily fixed. just be careful with the straps. the pouch is great and is very good to put on your bike so you won't run the risk of anything dropping while riding.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this bag! i can fit my phone ,keys and sunglasses in it. it is not bulky and fits nice on my bike."
5.0 out of 5 stars,just like it was advertised. it was just the thing i needed to hold some small tools and a bike lock. works great for me.
5.0 out of 5 stars,fast shipping. works great on the bike. able to phone and wallet. just what i was looking for. well made.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"so far it serves it's purpose, i took a precautionary measure and used seam sealer around the entire bag for the rainy season. the zipper takes some getting used to but overall i really like the bag."
4.0 out of 5 stars,the bag was great for several months. the divider on the inside ripped at the bottom so now the bag isn't as functional as before.
5.0 out of 5 stars,great little bike bag
5.0 out of 5 stars,"came yesterday, i like it."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"nice design. got it on ""today's deals"". regular price is a little high."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"great storage bag for the price paid, no complaints"
3.0 out of 5 stars,"perfect for dry weather, not so great for wet weather. but a nice little storage bag overrall, i'll keep using and switch out to a waterproof as needed."
5.0 out of 5 stars,nice. lots of storage space
5.0 out of 5 stars,fits perfect
5.0 out of 5 stars,great big bag. functional. great seller
5.0 out of 5 stars,great bag. fits everything.
5.0 out of 5 stars,looks good and works perfectly
1.0 out of 5 stars,strap broke while trying to install. pure junk
4.0 out of 5 stars,got this as a gift for my brother. he says it works great for his needs. thanks a bunch
5.0 out of 5 stars,i use it for my wheelchair & it works great because it is easier to access than my previous gadgets. thanks!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"nice cheap bag for small items (hold my tools and chain oil, etc. ). seems pretty durable but the zipper is not great and i can see this becoming an issue over time."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i like it,small but compact"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i like this pouch fits exactly and very useful to carry your mobile, wallet on ride....i got this on a deal worth for the price i spent. straps strong enough to hold a bottle on your ride..."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i liked everything about this it works great and fits my bike really well
5.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to install, adjust a little bit, and access. two phones, a wallet, and keys fit with room to spare. wouldn't ride a bike without one."
5.0 out of 5 stars,just the right size. straps are well placed. i was able to fit all the stuff that i need for emergency whenever i go biking. great quality material.
4.0 out of 5 stars,"great compact size and does fit most bikes (not some dual suspension), but very practical and helpful if you don't want to have anything in your pockets or have a small backpack all the time. can't say it's some leading edge tech, just a nice accessory"
5.0 out of 5 stars,it fits bike multi tool and patch kit and other spare parts well.
4.0 out of 5 stars,great fit for my bike
1.0 out of 5 stars,product was so big for the bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,sturdy bag for kid stuff and phone
5.0 out of 5 stars,"easy to install on the bike, and i feel better with my gear attached to the frame vs under the seat."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"for road biking maybe this is fine, but one trip with my mountain bike and the straps ripped from the bag. not very durable."
5.0 out of 5 stars,good product that fit the frame well. good amount of space for storage.
3.0 out of 5 stars,it seems like a good product but just beware if you have an aluminum frame bike that in might not fit. my bike has an aluminum frame and the straps won't fit around the bars because the are kind of big.
1.0 out of 5 stars,it’s to flimsy
5.0 out of 5 stars,great affordable bike storage. no better place to keep your wallet keys and any other small item while out cycling.
5.0 out of 5 stars,good product and shipped fast
5.0 out of 5 stars,the velcro straps worked perfectly on my bike. it had ample space to hold my phone and cards etc. i would definitely get another one for my wife's bike.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"amazing, fits perfectly, and can hold tons"
5.0 out of 5 stars,love the way it fits my bike
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i like the product very much, it does exactly what i was looking for it to do."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"one of the straps broke within the hour, the rest of the straps broke off the next day"
4.0 out of 5 stars,thank you. product as described
5.0 out of 5 stars,large size that meets my wife's needs....
5.0 out of 5 stars,fits bike great and holds more stuff than i expected.
5.0 out of 5 stars,this saddle bag works great. it is out of the way and holds everything you need for a ride.
5.0 out of 5 stars,good bag for budged oriented customer
4.0 out of 5 stars,"no review, gave as a gift."
5.0 out of 5 stars,buena calidad
5.0 out of 5 stars,very useful and fits well on bike
1.0 out of 5 stars,"zipper split on the 3rd ride, lost some tools because of it. bottom corner of the bag is a bit floppy side to side too."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"nice pouch, i use it for my mini pro segway, good fit"
4.0 out of 5 stars,"very handy, installed in a second"
3.0 out of 5 stars,looks good
3.0 out of 5 stars,"delivery was goodbag is ok, have a lot of space,however if you have a cage bottle below it, you wont be able to handle to both at the same time."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"all the info in the ad via seller is true so don’t wanna be redundant n u can extract most info from there but here ya go.....strong zipper, didn’t test water resistance but will give it benefit of doubt on that, vivid yellow color, material is average at best so dunno on durability yet but very attractive pkg if a gift.contact points is the achilles heel as i can see the need to enhance these later. def built to a price point too. holds alotta crap and that may be its downfall over time as it’s not heavy duty. keys, phone, tools etc is bout it. maybe a bandaid n neosporin as well👍these bags sure are superior than the “behind the seat” type as soooo ez to get stuff on the side of bike vs under arse. i didn’t want a handle bar mounted one as too cumbersome n obtrusive n’ goofy.this tho is quite stylish & 15 bucks?ya-go for it!!🏁"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bag is of good quality and it's worthy of most purchasers and bikes, but it's built for frames that are larger in that the straps barely have any ""hook and loop"" to grab after it revolves around a standard frame. it will work for a standard frame (i have an original ""stump jumper"") but most newer bikes are probably going to be larger and it will work much better for those larger frames. the only other thing that i would have liked is to have the zipper (access) on the ""right"" side of the bag (most people are right handed) instead of the left which this one is. it keeps you from being able to get into the bag in transit and even stopped it's not as convenient."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this bike bag is just the right size. you can fit an iphone in the bag, you can also fit a wallet and keys to your house. it is just the right size for a few things to take with you on a long bike right. i do bike about 20-25 miles often. i can fit 3 granola bars and my phone in this bag. the bag is out of the way and does not cause any problems."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"love this little bag. fits my bike exactly like in the picture. i carry a phone, gloves, spare tire, pump and tools in case of a flat. this bag carries it all and does not impede the ride in any way. it allowed me to stop using a backpack for these items (the backpack was uncomfortable in the hot summer months)."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"it holds your stuff. easy to install, decent storage capacity. i keep a small tire pump, patch kit, and some small tools, and can still squeeze in a snack size baggie full of trail mix, and a granola bar with no problem. not big enough for a sandwich though."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"i have maybe removed this a total of 5 time and one of the velcro straps already failed, i had to tape it together with very little weight. can do not recommend this product,"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"works great! i have a 21"" mtn bike with 29"" tires. i have a water bottle holder on the bar from the pedals to the gooseneck and it fits. might not fit smaller bikes with water bottles. will fit a 16oz water bottle, flat repair tools, phone, and keys, with room to spare."
5.0 out of 5 stars,very well made bag. i have no complaint at all. the only change i made was to cut away the velcro and attached black heavy duty zip ties instead. looks great. highly recommended.
5.0 out of 5 stars,it's a good storage place and a good amount of space for where it sits. i just wish it had a way to possibly ad some type of lock.
