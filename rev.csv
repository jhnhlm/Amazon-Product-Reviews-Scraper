Stars,Reviews
4.0 out of 5 stars,"performs as advertised. highly recommend. my feedback below.  effective device - light weight - secure - comfortable (after initial 5 minutes of running and proper adjustment) - compact - pocket for keys and id  could be more effective if... - zipper makes noise while running. noticeable if out running without headphones. must tuck zipper pull inside zipper pocket as a fix - iphone 12 plus fits well. hard to get in and out on hot (texas) day due to sticking of plastic and moisture - vest has a snug fit on a very hot day gets occasionally uncomfortable. not a concern in spring, fall, or winter months. only on hot and humid days when you are running 10 mile + runs - removing after a long, hard run is doable but a front clip would be advantageous"
3.0 out of 5 stars,good concept and hope it will last. however i‚Äôm disappointed that the space for the phone will not allow a phone with ottherbox covering to fit. so i‚Äôm gonna have to remove the cover every time i want to use this which as you may know is a real pain in the neck. i should have asked this question prior to purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i never realized how great and free it feels to run without your phone in your hand until i tried it. of course you don't want to run with your phone banging against your thigh while it's in your pocket, so this vest solves the problem. it keeps your phone nice and snug against your chest. it has a single button which secures the top of the phone pouch to the vest, so when you need to check your phone, it's really easy to undo the button, check your phone, and button it back up. the phone pouch fits all phone sizes, and the one in the photos is an iphone xs max which it fits perfectly. the vest also has two smaller pockets on the shoulders which i use for my car key so i don't risk it falling out of my shorts pocket during a run. i can't recommend this product enough!"
1.0 out of 5 stars,product came fast and packaged nicely! super lightweight bag and trendy design. however the item it self smells like the worst material you could use for a running product. i don‚Äôt know how it could still smell while at amazon. as well as transport. leads me to think it will always smell like plastic\rubber blend. will report back-
2.0 out of 5 stars,yeah this sucks having to squeeze your iphone 11 into the phone pocket and ripping it on initial unboxing. has a good feel but not much room for the phone and reflective isn‚Äôt the best.
4.0 out of 5 stars,the vest looks really nice and i wish it would‚Äôve been useful for me. i have an iphone 11 with a case and it was snug when i put it in the front pocket. i don‚Äôt want to keep having that issue every time i put my phone in it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,actually i used to put a small nike bag on my back to keep my towel or my phone inside of it and i was thinking it would be nice to have something that i can put my phone in front of me and when i got home i was looking on instagram and this came up freetrain. i said wow this is what i'm looking for so immediately i ordered it off amazon i love it it's easily accessible my only drawback is that i wish you could clamp it in the front once you put it over your head it makes it a little more easy to put on and to put off otherwise it's a great product!
3.0 out of 5 stars,"this was great for running. light weight no pressure points that would rub. snap worked great. clear plastic over the phone did allow me to use my touch screen. however, i only gave it two stars because the velcro broke about a month after getting it. my husband bought the black version and his is just fine"
5.0 out of 5 stars,i always get texts or phone calls when running long distance. i have to answer the phone for my job. this makes it easy to do that and keep running  plus nice to hear the music while running without headphones.  can change music easily while running.  also has a key holder.  love this thing
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love that it is positioned very well on my body. it‚Äôs way better than having something on my waist. it makes my workout better. great examples was i ran six miles today with comfort. i have a iphone 12 which fit perfectly in the case. i don‚Äôt like the plastic material on the cell, felt like it have been something better. besides that so far so good"
5.0 out of 5 stars,i love this product. when i run and wear a waistband i feel my phone on my hip bouncing up and down. this keeps my phone controlled. i have a couple neat spots to keep my keys or gel. on the inside my mace fits perfect. i don‚Äôt even feel like i‚Äôm wearing it.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i wear this on every run i go on, can't leave with out it! i love the way it fits, the adjustable straps make it very easy to fit however you want it to. i like to wear it snug on myself. it's the perfect place to keep my phone, house key, and a gel for when i'm distance running. i'd recommend this to anyone who runs regularly and needs a piece of gear to help hold their items."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"really don‚Äôt like laying my ph on the gym floor or have it in my pocket, so annoying. this here is a game changer! so glad i stumbled across an infomercial and the rest is history. purchased the silver one thinking of buying the black one soon."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"i love this vest. when i used to run before,i always had my phone in my hand. now i have free hands, and can carry my mask, keys, id in the other pockets. very light weight too. i originally ordered the gray one., i've just ordered the black one.  one is your phone fingerprint cant be read through the protective plastic. i had to cut a circle to line up with my phone fingerprint icon, so i didn't have to pullout the phone from the pouch each time i needed to do/change something."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"gets sweaty during runs and hikes. i tried returning it after 1st try when using this but amazon won't give full credit with refund. ended up donating, too sweaty to wear if u have a chest unless u like boob sweat"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"love this vest for running. fits super comfortably and lightweight. touchscreen through the phone compartment. small zip pocket perfect for keys. i like that there aren‚Äôt clips and is just slip on. can be hard to get off after a long run, but would rather that problem than being uncomfortable while running. zipper sound is a bit annoying without headphones, but put a piece of tape on it & you‚Äôre good to go. highly recommend."
5.0 out of 5 stars,i've logged thousands of miles with my keys and phone bouncing around in my pocket. sometimes i'd resort to holding them in my hand to prevent this. the freetrain v1 vest solved my problems. my phone is easily accessible in the front pouch and my keys are secured in the dedicated compartment. should've gotten this sooner!
1.0 out of 5 stars,"an absolute waste of money, unless you have a free obama phone. who really is going to keep removing thier phone case. the opening is sooooooo small, it's non flexible material, so it can't stretch to accommodate newer model. phones."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"this vest is all you need fro carrying your keys, credit cards and phone while you are out running. it is in great materials and very light weight which gives you great comfort while running."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"i was informed that package will be delayed, but was eventually delivered"
3.0 out of 5 stars,heavy vest for florida running. no hydration. comfortable.
5.0 out of 5 stars,"my samsung galaxy plus phone fit! light weight, not bothersome on my chest."
3.0 out of 5 stars,great product but could not be used for my phone as it fits a iphone 6 size
4.0 out of 5 stars,very good product
4.0 out of 5 stars,all 4 star because the key area very small and the phone always gets stuck.
5.0 out of 5 stars,never run without my freetrain. by far the best piece of running equipment and carry your phone and keys. worth every penny!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"perfect for a run, walk hike or hit. love this thing. it fits my note 9 phone too!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,love this vest so much. it‚Äôs so convenient i don‚Äôt have to worry about my phone falling out of my pockets or my keys uncomfortably tapping against my leg!
5.0 out of 5 stars,"so this is great because you can go running it doesn't bounce over the place and you can still flip it down and have access to your phone, change songs, check text messages etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars,yup hmmm hmm yup üòÅüëç
5.0 out of 5 stars,was so doubtful and unsure when i bought it but super comfy and works well for runs and gym workouts
5.0 out of 5 stars,finally something that does not fall off you arm. in love with this vest.
4.0 out of 5 stars,i like how easy it is to slip on. phone fit perfect. you can use a bluetooth or earphones that connect. i brought 2 of them.
5.0 out of 5 stars,love
5.0 out of 5 stars,love the product!! just wish there was an easier way for putting on and taking off!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars,it's a tight fit but fits s21 ultra. great idea for runners that have big phones.
4.0 out of 5 stars,this product has worked well for me. holds my phone and keys while i go on my runs.

5.0 out of 5 stars,running
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i am a fairly new runner and have been trying to find a good solution for what to do with my phone as i run. i hoped that this would be the solution i was looking for, but i quickly discovered that putting my phone into this vest was going to be a problem. i have an iphone 11 pro max that i keep in a case... and there was no way that was going to fit into the phone pocket. even without the case, just the phone was a very tight fit that was difficult to put into the pocket and difficult to remove. now having done that a few times, the pocket itself is stretched-out without a phone in it such that it no longer sits flat when empty."
1.0 out of 5 stars,"where to start‚Ä¶ i purchased v1 during the pandemic and after 3-4 months, it became too loose all over. i washed as instructed, but i figured i‚Äôd been running a lot during the pandemic and why not give the new vr a try.  this model is even worse. the clasp/button to the compartment holding my phone doesn‚Äôt stay shut, so i‚Äôd have to stop and reattach often. plus, every area of this became warped and deteriorated even faster.  i contacted customer service and the best they could offer was 20% off my next purchase of their janky products.  skip these. save your money. they‚Äôre not comfy, look nerdy as hell and don‚Äôt even work well. look at the photos of this pos after normal use."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"i really wanted to like this as this was something i am desperately looking for to enhance my running without having to bring too much stuff with me on my runs, but this was a big fail. the product itself is great but it sits way too high on the chest and looks ridiculous. i am about a 36dd and i could barely get this to sit flat... obviously this was meant for men or women with a smaller chest. if they made this that was a touch wider and had the strap band that sat more on the hip that would be great. such a shame since this is exactly what i was looking for."
4.0 out of 5 stars,"i haven't used it yet but i am excited to try it tomorrow on my run. the only thing about it that i don't like is that it sits so high on my chest. it has an adjustable waist band so an adjustable height band would be nice. i have an old lg galaxy 3 phone and it does fit in the pocket but it is a tight fit and i have to take my phone out of the case, so a bigger phone pocket would be nice. but overall the only downside is that the height doesn't adjust."
5.0 out of 5 stars,loving this vest. i was looking for something simple that could hold my essentials while running. i‚Äôm basic so i just go out with my keys and phone. i‚Äôm really digging the flip down function on the phone holder for you to check your phone without fully removing it from the phone holder. def recommend!
1.0 out of 5 stars,worked out twice with this nice looking vest but sweat got to the phone and while running the phone pocket flops open so no good
5.0 out of 5 stars,"wish black was in stock when i ordered mine, never the less color doesn‚Äôt change how it works.  fits snug on my chest and my iphone 12 fits perfectly in the pouch. didn‚Äôt bounce all over the place while running and at a certain point i forgot it was even there.  i‚Äôll see how it holds up after washing it but so far so good. i‚Äôd recommend it."
3.0 out of 5 stars,"la idea es buena pero el espacio para el celular es reducido, tengo un iphone 12 pro max y tengo que quitarle la funda para que pueda caber; por otra parte el cierre que trae me caus√≥ enfado despu√©s de algunas carreras cortas por el ruido que hace (una protecci√≥n de goma estar√≠a genial, finalmente lo que m√°s me incomoda es que como vivo en una ciudad con clima c√°lido al usar el chaleco se siente bastante molesto por el calor que se genera con traerlo puesto, supongo que esa parte quedara de lado en invierno."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"waited a while for the black vest to be restocked and i am so happy to receive it today. i'm using flip belt for my run but it is quite difficult to slot in the phone because i am using samsung note 20 ultra which is kinda big for the belt. happy that freetrain could fit my phone (without my phone case, anyway flip belt couldn't either) nicely. tried doing burpees, jumping jack, tuck and jump and the belt stays in place. i am so happy that i made the right choice, runners must have!"
